    Vision

    EESI will build an extraordinary community of scholars who cross boundaries
    to understand the Earth system, how it affects people, and how people
    affect it.

    Mission

    EESI's mission comprises three interrelated elements:

     1. To encourage interdisciplinary examination of the links between Earth’s
        chemical, physical, and biological processes from atomic to global
        scales by supporting faculty, student, and postdoctoral research on
        Earth sciences and environmental issues;
     2. To facilitate dissemination of research findings through publications,
        presentations, web pages, workshops, seminars, testimony to public
        agencies, and advice to public and private organizations and agencies;
        and
     3. To develop innovative, interdisciplinary research and education
        programs that benefit internal and external stakeholders, including the
        Penn State community, the Commonwealth, scientific communities, and
        federal and state science agencies and organizations.

    EESI History

    From ESSC to EESI

    The vision for the Earth System Science Center (ESSC), the precursor of
    EESI, began in the early 1980s through a strategic planning process that
    involved Penn State Central Administration, the Office of the Vice
    President for Research and Dean of the Graduate School, and the College of
    Earth and Mineral Sciences. The goal was to bring together faculty in the
    departments of Geosciences, Meteorology, Geography, and Energy,
    Environmental, and Mineral Economics in research activities focused on the
    search for links between the Earth’s physical processes and past and future
    global change.

    Eric Barron became the ESSC director in 1985. The Center coordinated and
    conducted extensive research related to the global water cycle, the
    biogeochemical cycles, Earth system history, and human impacts on the Earth
    system. In 1999, with the addition of the Center for Integrated Regional
    Assessment (CIRA) and the Center for Environmental Chemistry and
    Geochemistry (CECG), the EMS Environment Institute (EMS EI) was formed. The
    mission of EMS EI was to enhance the visibility of College environmental
    research and educational programs and to create opportunities for
    collaborative research in these areas. Additional research centers were
    added to the Institute to reflect the primary research areas represented by
    the Institute's core faculty associates.

    The Institute and its centers reflect the College of Earth and Mineral
    Sciences’ long and accomplished history of Earth sciences and environmental
    research. The computing and outreach components were incorporated at the
    time of the Institute's founding so that all elements needed for a
    successful, effective research organization would be present for the
    benefit of faculty and students affiliated with the Institute. In 2004, the
    EMS Environment Institute was renamed the Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute.

    Message from Director

    Sue Brantley

    Humans' unprecedented impact on the Earth’s system has led scientists to
    define a new geological age—the Anthropocene—to acknowledge human-induced
    changes on land, air, water, ice, and biota. To survive and flourish as a
    species in the face of this impact, we must learn to "earthcast" - that is,
    to predict how the Earth's climate and environment will change based on
    observations from the past and present and from our knowledge of humans.

    The Earth and Environmental Systems Institute is strategically positioned
    to engage in earthcasting. EESI associates and affiliates are
    world-renowned leaders in the kind of interdisciplinary, innovative, and
    collaborative research needed to take on the breadth of human-induced
    changes. The strength and diversity of their environmental sciences
    research promises the new knowledge, new approaches, and new models that
    are fundamental to understanding the Earth system, how it affects people,
    and how people affect it.

    We welcome you to learn more about EESI, one of the leading Earth and
    environmental sciences research institutes in the U.S.

    Research

    Research Services

    The Institute endeavors to develop initiatives or centers that focus on
    compelling scientific, social, and engineering issues and problems that
    require the expertise of more than a single researcher or even a single
    department. The expertise and strengths of academic departments in the
    College of Earth and Mineral Sciences often provide the foundation for
    these interdisciplinary initiatives and centers. The resources of the Earth
    and Environmental Systems Institute are designed to create added
    opportunities for faculty and students and to act as a catalyst for
    innovative, collaborative research.

    Faculty Services

    The Institute provides high-quality support services through its budget and
    grant management personnel, computing assistance through its Environmental
    Computing Facility, and outreach support through its outreach support teams
    and Center for Environmental Informatics. Proposal development, external
    funding opportunities searches, and editorial assistance are available to
    Institute faculty as well.

    Student Services

    Through its projects, data resources, and collaborative linkages, the
    Institute supports students interested in earth science and environmental
    research. Students gain valuable experience working as research assistants
    on Institute projects; often the research performed for a funded project
    stimulates a student's interest in the area under study, resulting in a
    thesis or dissertation project, and in co-authored publications. Through
    their work on Institute projects, students also have opportunities to
    "network", or make professional contacts that guide them as they make
    career decisions and look for employment. The Institute contributes to the
    College of Earth and Mineral Science’s broader educational mission by
    sponsoring speakers, seminar series, and other events in cooperation with
    other Penn State units.

    Research - Data Management Plan

    Data Management Plan

    Many agencies are now requiring more formal data management plans than in
    the past. These include:

      □ Office of Science and Technology Policy - The White House
          ☆ Expanding Public Access to the Results of Federally Funded Research
      □ National Science Foundation (NSF) Data Management Plan Requirements
      □ NASA Data Management Plan Guidance
      □ National Institutes of Health - NIH

    This page is designed to assist PI's in developing data management plans to
    support an otherwise successful proposal. This page is for guidance only
    and does not necessarily grant success. We welcome comments and feedback to
    help us ensure that the information here is up-to-date.

    Information provided here includes:

      □ available data repositories (predominantly those on campus),
      □ contacts who can provide help a PI to identify project-specific needs
        for data storage,
      □ generally asked questions about data storage, and
      □ advice on how to support someone who is helping to develop the data
        management plan and/or responsible for the data management during the
        life of the project.

    In many cases, it also helps to get an example data management plan (from a
    successfully funded proposal!).

    Energy-Related Research

    Initiative for Energy and Environmental Economics and Policy (EEEP)

    The Initiative for Energy and Environmental Economics and Policy focuses on
    the union between energy systems and environmental management and the
    development of quantitative tools to address decision challenges in these
    areas. Current projects include:

      □ The Program on Coupled Human-Environmental Systems (PCHES) engages
        researchers from engineering, economics, environmental modeling, and
        decision-making to establish an innovative framework for developing
        multi-sector, multi-scale, multi-modal approaches for integrated
        assessment.
      □ The gas-electric coordination project involves engineering, economic,
        and computational work that addresses the increasing interdependence
        between natural gas and electric power transmission.
      □ The Program on the Evolution of Future Energy Systems focuses on the
        integration of energy systems engineering and economic models with
        climate models and insights from robust decision-making. It addresses
        the under-studied aspects of how energy systems evolve in the face of
        long-term technological and policy changes or targets when important
        economic and climate factors are uncertain.

    EESI’s EarthTalks Seminar Series: Exploring Critical Environmental Issues

     

    EarthTalks LogoEarthTalks is EESI's semester-long interdisciplinary seminar
    series that seeks to engage the University and broader community in
    examination of some of the complex environmental challenges facing our
    world today.

    The weekly talks feature distinguished researchers and practitioners from
    Penn State as well as from other universities, government agencies and
    nonprofit organizations. Seminars are presented to both a live and online
    audience as well as archived with access through the EESI website.

    Recent EarthTalks series have been focused on the critical problems of
    climate change, protecting the planet's water resources and the
    environmental, technical, and social challenges presented by the
    development of the Marcellus Shale natural gas resource.

    EESI Faculty associates are encouraged to propose seminar topics of
    strategic interest to EESI to the EESI Director. EESI affiliates may also
    propose topics as appropriate. Faculty who propose topics are expected to
    develop the series in collaboration with a committee. The committee should
    include at least one member from an EMS Department other than the
    faculty-proposer and at least one member from a department in another
    college.

    EESI provides $5,000 in funding for EarthTalks as well as staff support to
    help with speakers' travel arrangements and campus schedules. Faculty are
    encouraged to leverage this support with funds from other units.

    The Dynamics of Deep Decarbonization
    Organizers: Seth Blumsack and Klaus Keller
    Co-Supported by: EESI, PESTL, CLIMA

    Achieving truly deep decarbonization is a uniquely difficult problem
    requiring fundamental changes in multiple interconnected systems (energy,
    agriculture, industry). Decisions made with the intent of avoiding the most
    severe climate change climatic impacts happen in the face of deep and
    dynamic uncertainties. Deep decarbonization decisions may also create
    multiple winners and losers and is thus a problem of managing social change
    in addition to technology transition. This EarthTalks series will invite
    prominent researchers to give talks on energy systems transition, negative
    carbon emissions, terrestrial sequestration, decision-making under
    uncertainty, and public policy relevant to deep decarbonization.

    Vision

    EESI will build an extraordinary community of scholars who cross boundaries
    to understand the Earth system, how it affects people, and how people
    affect it.

    Mission

    EESI's mission comprises three interrelated elements:

     1. To encourage interdisciplinary examination of the links between Earth’s
        chemical, physical, and biological processes from atomic to global
        scales by supporting faculty, student, and postdoctoral research on
        Earth sciences and environmental issues;
     2. To facilitate dissemination of research findings through publications,
        presentations, web pages, workshops, seminars, testimony to public
        agencies, and advice to public and private organizations and agencies;
        and
     3. To develop innovative, interdisciplinary research and education

    EESI History

    From ESSC to EESI

    The vision for the Earth System Science Center (ESSC), the precursor of
    EESI, began in the early 1980s through a strategic planning process that
    involved Penn State Central Administration, the Office of the Vice
    President for Research and Dean of the Graduate School, and the College of
    Earth and Mineral Sciences. The goal was to bring together faculty in the
    departments of Geosciences, Meteorology, Geography, and Energy,
    Environmental, and Mineral Economics in research activities focused on the
    search for links between the Earth’s physical processes and past and future
    global change.

    Eric Barron became the ESSC director in 1985. The Center coordinated and
    conducted extensive research related to the global water cycle, the
    biogeochemical cycles, Earth system history, and human impacts on the Earth
    system. In 1999, with the addition of the Center for Integrated Regional
    Assessment (CIRA) and the Center for Environmental Chemistry and
    Geochemistry (CECG), the EMS Environment Institute (EMS EI) was formed. The
    mission of EMS EI was to enhance the visibility of College environmental
    research and educational programs and to create opportunities for
    collaborative research in these areas. Additional research centers were
    added to the Institute to reflect the primary research areas represented by
    the Institute's core faculty associates.

    The Institute and its centers reflect the College of Earth and Mineral
    Sciences’ long and accomplished history of Earth sciences and environmental
    research. The computing and outreach components were incorporated at the
    time of the Institute's founding so that all elements needed for a
    successful, effective research organization would be present for the
    benefit of faculty and students affiliated with the Institute. In 2004, the
    EMS Environment Institute was renamed the Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute.

    Message from Director

    Sue Brantley

    Humans' unprecedented impact on the Earth’s system has led scientists to
    define a new geological age—the Anthropocene—to acknowledge human-induced
    changes on land, air, water, ice, and biota. To survive and flourish as a
    species in the face of this impact, we must learn to "earthcast" - that is,
    to predict how the Earth's climate and environment will change based on
    observations from the past and present and from our knowledge of humans.

    The Earth and Environmental Systems Institute is strategically positioned
    to engage in earthcasting. EESI associates and affiliates are
    world-renowned leaders in the kind of interdisciplinary, innovative, and
    collaborative research needed to take on the breadth of human-induced
    changes. The strength and diversity of their environmental sciences
    research promises the new knowledge, new approaches, and new models that
    are fundamental to understanding the Earth system, how it affects people,
    and how people affect it.

    We welcome you to learn more about EESI, one of the leading Earth and
    environmental sciences research institutes in the U.S.

    EESI Centers and Initiatives

    EESI Environmental Scholars

    In spring 2015, we initiated a revamped EESI Environmental Scholars program
    in the interest of forming connections between departments (and between
    research groups), increasing student diversity, and improving our
    recruiting efforts. The current EESI selection committee is comprised of
    Sridhar Anandakrishnan, professor of geosciences, Chris Forest, associate
    professor of meteorology, and Alan Taylor, professor of geography. Dr.
    Taylor is the current chair of the Committee. The Committee is charged with
    the following:

      □ Choosing a set of four Scholars competitively among the incoming and
        accepted graduate student applicants in the EESI-affiliated
        departments, and from EESI Associates initially (all PhD students)
      □ Sending out a call for nominations to EESI associates, and they will
        nominate a student (one who has been made an offer).
      □ The chair will make a ranked list based on the faculty members' summary
        of their qualifications, and the other committee members will advise.

    These Scholars will be part of a cohort of an ongoing recruitment tool that
    will eventually lead to a large enough group to have cohesion and impact.
    The scholars will be offered a $2K top-up in the first year. There will be
    few requirements if they do accept, though we will look for positive
    inducements (dinner, retreats, a cross-disciplinary seminar/lunch)

    The Committee Chair will send out an announcement early each spring to EESI
    Associates asking for nominations.

    Caitlin Teti has a blast when it comes to space exploration. And as the new
    education program coordinator for the NASA Pennsylvania Space Grant
    Consortium, or Space Grant, she gets to share her enthusiasm with other
    science and space fans.

    "When you hear people talk about NASA, it's always this really cool subject
    and their eyes light up," said Teti, who graduated in 2017 with a
    bachelor's degree in Earth science and policy from Penn State. "To help
    facilitate the connection between them and NASA is a really interesting
    part of my job."

    Teti connects individuals to NASA resources by coordinating outreach events
    that promote space and STEM education. She describes herself as a person
    who wants to hit the ground running when presented with a project that she
    finds exciting. That is just what she did shortly after starting with Space
    Grant in April. Teti took a leading role in organizing Penn State's Apollo
    11 50th anniversary events, which included a public rocket launch and a
    speaker and film event featuring former NASA astronaut James Pawelczyk,
    associate professor of physiology and kinesiology at Penn State. The events
    attracted more than 200 and 400 attendees, respectively.

    "Being able to put on these free events for the community is really nice,"
    she said. "I've done a lot of work with the communities inside and outside
    State College through a couple grant programs. Being able to give the
    communities free access to science events and inspiring the next generation
    of scientists and people who are interested in space has been my
    motivation."

    Teti has ample experience connecting people to science. Before joining
    Space Grant, she worked in various roles at the Shaver's Creek
    Environmental Center. She began as an intern while enrolled at Penn State
    and eventually assumed the role of on-site director of the center's Outdoor
    School, where she helped advance the program and develop the curriculum.
    She also managed 75 campers and 30 university student workers. Teti said
    she gained many skills at Shaver's Creek that she could not in the
    traditional classroom setting, like group management, leadership and
    effective communication – skills she uses in her role at Space Grant.

    This fall semester she looks forward to working with the undergraduate and

    When Jenni Evans mentions ensembles, she's not talking about music but
    tropical cyclones. Evans, professor of meteorology and director of the
    Institute for CyberScience at Penn State, takes an extensive approach to
    studying cyclones that begin in the tropics and then undergo structural
    changes as they move into the mid-latitudes.

    "We use really cool machine learning techniques to understand how to take
    150 forecasts of one storm at one time and to understand physically what
    those forecasts mean," Evans said. "We look at the U.S., Canadian, European
    and U.K. models. At the moment we don't use the Japanese or Australian
    models, but that's because we haven't gotten there yet."

    Meteorologists call the collection of forecasts an ensemble and use it to
    identify the range of possibility for a storm. For instance, if the models
    predict that a storm will go into the Gulf of Mexico and the ensemble says
    that the storm will not travel farther north than Georgia, then individuals
    are pretty safe in North Carolina and almost certainly safe in
    Massachusetts, Evans explained. She wants to use the ensemble data to
    improve storm forecasts.

    Evans is also working with Mark Ballora, professor of music technology, and
    researcher Alex Kowaleski to sonify hurricanes. Sonification involves
    mapping numbers to sounds, Evans said. She works with Ballora to assign
    different sounds to key components of hurricanes, such as wind speed, water
    temperature, symmetry, and latitude. For instance, they use a "whoop whoop
    whoop" to indicate the fastest windspeeds, and the whoops get faster as the
    winds speed up; they also use a "duh duh duh" sound to indicate latitude,
    and the sound gets deeper as the storm moves out of the tropics and passes
    over the cooler water of the higher latitudes. Building on this research,
    Evans is currently working with colleagues in Australia to apply
    sonification to climate change.

    Furthermore, Evans is working with faculty partners in the Department of
    Meteorology, former postdoctoral scholar Holly Hamilton, and PhD candidate
    Kelly Nuñez Ocasio to understand how African easterly waves form. African
    easterly waves are areas of relatively low atmospheric pressure that form
    over Africa when hot air from the Sahara Desert meets the cooler, more
    humid air from the tropical monsoon.

    From solving a food crisis to changing how scientists understand the fossil
    record of early life on Earth, Julie Cosmidis sees big solutions under the
    microscope.

    Assistant professor of geosciences and principal investigator of The
    Biomineral Factory at Penn State, Cosmidis studies the processes by which
    bacteria form minerals, called biomineralization, and how scientists use
    these processes to identify the presence of life in the rock record. She
    also studies organomineralization, the role of organic materials in mineral
    formation.

    "These processes are important as they control the mobility and
    bio-availability of different elements in geochemical cycles," said
    Cosmidis. Her lab work focuses on the minerals phosphate, elemental sulphur
    and calcium carbonate.

    Phosphate is an important ingredient in fertilizer and can increase crop
    yields by 50 percent. Scientists expect that mining activity will deplete
    all natural phosphate reserves in the coming decades. Cosmidis thinks the
    bacteria responsible for kidney stones may hold the answer to this problem.

    Some types of kidney stones form when E. coli in the body turns urine into
    phosphate minerals.

    "All the phosphates that a human expels through urination equals the amount
    of the minerals we are mining from rocks that will soon be depleted,"
    Cosmidis said.

    She recreates the process in her lab using synthetic urine. Cosmidis wants
    to find a sustainable method for collecting phosphates from urine and then
    optimize the process so scientists can use waste to create fertilizer.

    Cosmidis also studies elemental sulfur and its role as a biosignature. A
    biosignature is a physical clue that suggests the presence of life.
    Elemental sulfur forms when bacteria interact with sulfides. Under a
    microscope the bacteria have a slender, threadlike shape. Scientists
    looking at fossilized records view this as proof of life in the past. This
    may not be the case, according to Cosmidis.

    As Earth and Environmental Systems Institute scientists engage in research
    to understand, predict and find solutions for the most compelling
    environmental issues of our time, Francisco Tutella draws on his experience
    as a writer and former educator to help them communicate their findings.

    As the Institute's public relations specialist, Tutellawrites compelling
    stories about the diverse topics studied by EESI researchers. Topics
    include climate change and prediction, greenhouse gas emissions, the impact
    of natural gas development on watersheds in the Marcellus Shale region, the
    use of the internet and social media to predict and respond to natural
    disasters, ice sheets and sea level change, environmental economics,
    critical zone science and climate risk management.

    "I have always been interested in science. Also, I like the challenge that
    science writing poses, of taking a complex topic and making it accessible
    to all readers," Tutella says. "Here at EESI I have the opportunity to
    learn more by interviewing the scientists about their groundbreaking
    research, and I have the pleasure of communicating their important findings
    to audiences across Pennsylvania, the nation and the world."

    In his spare time, Tutella likes to hike, kayak and read. He can spend
    hours in coffee shops and bookstores. He also writes fiction and poetry and
    dabbles in Italian translation.

    Prior to joining EESI in spring 2019, Tutella taught academic writing,
    literature, Italian and English as a second language in northeast
    Pennsylvania. He also worked as a freelance writer for Wilkes University,
    where he earned an MFA in creative writing and honed his science writing
    skills as a graduate assistant in the marketing and communications
    department.

    Sierra Melton dreams of being on ice. The Penn State graduate student
    studies glaciers and hopes to travel to Antarctica one day to see her
    subjects first hand.

    Her journey brought her to Penn State, where she is a first-year graduate
    student studying glaciology with her advisors Richard Alley and Sridhar
    Anandakrishnan.

    "I've known for a long time I wanted to do some sort of science," Melton
    said. "I feel geoscience is a really good combination of what I love and
    something that's very meaningful to society."

    Melton has been selected as one of the 2018-19 Earth and Environmental
    Systems Institute Environmental Scholars.

    The scholarships are offered annually to graduate students to form
    connections between departments in the College of Earth and Mineral
    Sciences, and to increase student diversity.

    Melton received her undergraduate degree at Colorado College in geology.
    She has a diverse background in geosciences thanks to a pair of summer
    undergraduate research experiences.

    She worked at the University of Texas Marine Science Institute studying
    nitrogen cycling in tidally influenced rivers and estuaries. At North
    Carolina State University, she worked with remote sensing equipment to
    study soil erosion at active construction sites.

    Along the way, Melton became interested in glaciology. The idea of studying
    a problem straight from the headlines – climate change and sea-level rise –
    appealed to her.

    "I decided that I wanted to focus on issues that are happening right now,"
    she said. "I also really decided that I would rather focus on the physics
    side and problems that can be looked at with remote sensing,"

    Melton learned more about glaciology while studying abroad in Copenhagen,
    and her instructors there discussed research opportunities back in the
    United States.

    When Sarah Ivory says she's found a goldmine, it's probably not what you'd
    expect. The paeloecologist and new Penn State professor of Geosciences
    finds treasure in a most unusual place – well-preserved piles of ancient
    animal droppings.

    Ivory's research involves the study of past ecosystem changes, and
    fossilized urine despots, also called middens, can provide valuable clues
    about ancient vegetation.

    "We name all the sites we find," Ivory said. "One was called the hyrax
    goldmine."

    Hyrax are small mammals that look like rodents, but are actually most
    closely related to elephants and manatees. Their habit of using the same
    spot to do their business over many generations can provide important clues
    about the past.

    Ivory is searching for preserved pollen samples that can tell a story about
    vegetation and climate thousands of years ago. That information can better
    inform future conservation strategies.

    This fall, Ivory will travel to Oman to conduct additional research.

    "We are going to be hiking through the desert, climbing cliffs and looking
    for fossilized urinary deposits," she said.

    Ivory recently joined Penn State as an assistant professor in the
    Department of Geosciences. She is also an associate in the Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute.

    She received her Ph.D. from the University of Arizona and worked there as a
    postdoctoral researcher and as a postdoctoral fellow at Brown University
    before coming to Penn State.

    "I'm very excited about coming to Penn State, because they seem to have a
    very strong promotion of and support for interdisciplinary research," she
    said. "I'm really looking forward to being in an environment where that's
    really valued.

    A flood of data is available at our fingertips thanks to things like social
    media and the internet. This data can be helpful in predicting and
    responding to natural disasters, but finding the right information in the
    deluge can be time consuming and difficult.

    That's where new EESI associate Guido Cervone and his Geoinformatics and
    Earth Observation laboratory (GEOlab) come in to play.

    Cervone, associate professor of geoinformatics and associate director of
    the Institute for CyberScience, and his lab work to develop algorithms that
    can quickly analyze large amounts of data and incorporate useful
    information from social media feeds.

    The group is working to help flood prediction and response, to better
    understand short and long-term climate predictions for agriculture and
    energy forecasting and to collect data after environmental disasters like
    the 2011 Fukuskinma nuclear accident.

    "Our research is improving society's ability to forecast and respond to a
    range of research areas, including flooding and other natural disasters, as
    well as segments of the energy market, including solar and wind energy
    prediction," Cervone told Penn State news. "Our methodologies could
    ultimately have a big impact in both disaster response and our transition
    to renewable energies."

    In addition to his appointments in EESI and Geography and Meteorology and
    Atmospheric Sciences, Cervone is co-chair for the Research Computing
    CyberInfrastructure Executive Committee (RCCI) under the office of the Vice
    President for Research.

    He also holds the appointments of Affiliate Scientist at the National
    Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and Adjunct Faculty at the
    Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), Columbia University. He serves as
    program co-chair for the Natural Hazards focus group of the American
    Geophysical Union (AGU) and Chair for the Education and Outreach advisory
    board of NCAR. In 2013, he received the 'Medaglia di Rappresentanza' from

    Michele "Shelly" McCall hopes she's made the last few months a little
    easier for the people of the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute.

    "I'm a problem solver," she said. "I like solving problems, helping people
    and making their lives a little easier."

    Shelly was hired in June to be an administrative support assistant for
    EESI. She's done a little bit of everything since – planning events and
    coordinating calendars, providing office support to EESI centers, even
    acting as the unofficial face of the institute, greeting those who come
    through the doors in need of assistance.

    Now Shelly will be filling the institute's vacant financial coordinator
    position, where she will handle a range a financial responsibilities to
    help keep EESI running smoothly.

    She previously worked in administrative support at the Facilities
    Engineering Institute at the College of Engineering, a position she says
    prepared her for her next chapter.

    "She came to us with much of the basic financial knowledge and the
    experience needed in this new position," Tracy Bernier, EESI administrative
    support coordinator, said in announcing Shelly's new position. "We are
    excited that she wants to accept this new, challenging opportunity."

    Shelly said she is happy to stay in EESI and take on new challenges within
    the institute.

    "It's been interesting to see the environmental side of it," she said of
    her experiences in EESI. "That's what's been different for me."

    Recently married, Shelly lives with her husband and children in a home
    outside Centre Hall. Between them, the couple have five children, including
    three currently enrolled within the Penn State system.

    Odette Mina works quickly. It's a skill she honed through a career working
    for engineering consulting firms.

    Now she is bringing that work ethic to her new job, as managing director of
    the Energy and Environmental Sustainability Laboratories (EESL) at Penn
    State.

    "I'm pretty excited with how much we've been able to accomplish in just
    five months," said Mina, who joined EESL in February, becoming its first
    managing director.

    Mina has hit the ground running. In her first few months, she has helped
    set rates for the use of all EESL equipment and has pushed forward on a new
    website and other marketing materials to help raise the facility's profile.

    Funded by Penn State Institute of Energy and the Environment, EESL is a
    collection of high-tech laboratories located across campus. The goal is to
    give researchers shared access to equipment they may need to conduct their
    research, but might not have funding to purchase on their own.

    "We are a multi-user facility, open to all users across Penn State, other
    academic institutions and industry partners," she said. "We really provide
    state-of-the-art instruments they wouldn't necessarily have the ability to
    access if we didn't have these facilities available to them."

    EESL's impressive list of equipment includes instrumentation that can
    reveal the ages of ancient materials through high-precision carbon dating
    and that offer high-resolution 3-D imaging of objects, among many others.

    Managing all these labs may seem like a big job, but it's one Mina was
    ready for.

    "I managed laboratory services for commercial labs for many years, and then
    I managed environmental health and safety consulting services for many more
    years, she said. "So I have pretty strong experience in the business aspect
    of managing science and engineering, with a focus on laboratories."

    Their research focuses on a Native America tribal nation's forested home in
    Wisconsin, or on leaf fossils found in remote Patagonia, or perhaps even
    right in Penn State's backyard. But they have at least one thing in common
    – they are the 2017-18 Earth and Environmental Scholars.

    Stacey Olsen (Geography), Gabriella Rossetto (Geosciences) and Perri
    Silverhart (Geosciences) have been selected as this year's scholars. The
    scholarships are offered annually to graduate students to form connections
    between department in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, and to

    Gabriella Rossetto (photo)And diverse is a good way to describe their
    research.

    Stacey Olsen is studying the impact that invasive species like the Emerald
    Ash Borer could have on the forests maintained by the Menominee people – a
    Native America tribal national in Wisconsin.

    Her work is part of a National Science Foundation funded project to study
    cultural and economic challenges climate change will play on the
    reservation, and how it could inform decision-making about forest
    management.

    "I was drawn to the project for its interdisciplinary nature, and because
    it also incorporates indigenous knowledge and values systems," Olsen said.

    Olsen uses ecological modeling software that can predict impacts of
    biological disturbances on the forest and analyze them against other
    factors, like a changing climate.

    Perri Silverhart (photo)Gabriella Rossetto's work finds her in far-away
    South America. She is studying the monkey puzzle tree, an endangered type
    of evergreen described as a "living fossil" due to the longevity of the

    Debbie Lambert does it all.

    From organizing workshops and seminars, to greeting guests as they come
    through the doors and answering their questions, to ordering the supplies
    that keep the office running smoothly, Lambert has been a
    jack-of-all-trades for the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute.

    Now, after more than 14 years with EESI and more than 22 with Penn State,
    Lambert is set to retire in June.

    "I'm a little worried the plants won't get watered after I'm gone," she
    said with a smile.

    Lambert wears many hats for EESI and is an invaluable member of the team,
    helping faculty, staff and visitors alike on any number or projects and in
    solving countless issues.

    She is the unofficial face of EESI, and those who work closely with her
    quickly appreciate her good humor and her depth of knowledge about the
    institute.

    Lambert worked at a number of positions at Penn State before coming to
    EESI, including the Department of Geosciences, where she was a staff
    assistant for now-EESI director Susan L. Brantley. Lambert was interested
    in working for EESI because of the new opportunities it presented.

    "I thought there would be new opportunities," she said. "I really did like
    geosciences, and I really missed working with the students. But I really
    like my job here. I'm very happy with greeting people and helping people."

    Coincidentally, Lambert was soon reunited with Brantley, who was appointed
    director of EESI. Brantley was replacing former director Eric Barron, who
    at the time had left the university but has since returned to become its
    president.

    Lambert said she can now look back on how much EESI has grown since she
    started at the institute. "It was on a much smaller scale than what it is
    now," she said. "It's really grown since then."

    From weather systems on the west coast of Africa to wildfires in
    California, a pair of Penn State graduate students are pursuing their
    passions – with some help from the Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute.

    Graduate students Kelly Nunez Ocasio (Meteorology) and Natalie Pawlikowski
    (Geography) are the 2016-17 EESI Environmental Scholars. The scholarships,
    offered each year, are partly aimed at forming connection between
    departments and increasing student diversity.

    For Nunez Ocasio, the work she is doing at Penn State hits close to home.
    She was raised in Puerto Rico, and lived through Hurricane Georges, a
    powerful Category 4 hurricane that caused significant damage throughout the
    Caribbean and along the Gulf of Mexico in 1998.

    "Ever since I was a kid I experienced tropical storms and hurricanes," she
    said. "I lived the impact of Hurricane Georges and how it affected everyone
    for months. So I was intrigued about how I can help my community."

    That journey brought her to Penn State, where she is studying weather
    systems that form in the West African region and potentially churn across
    the Atlantic Ocean and develop into hurricanes and tropical storms. She
    works with Jenni Evans, professor of meteorology and director of the
    Institute for CyberScience.

    "What I'm trying to do is better understand how these storms relate to the
    topography of Africa, the atmosphere," Nunez Ocasio said. "How do they
    become potential hazards? We want to be able to track them and understand
    them better to put this information in models and predictions to better
    prepare our society."

    Western African is a long way away from where Pawlikowski finds herself
    working. She spent last summer in California, where she studied how fire
    management strategies have changed forest composition in one area.

    "Alan Taylor (a Penn State geography professor) did a pretty extensive
    study of Beaver Creek Pinery in Northern California in 1998, and what I did
    was go out and help remeasure it to see how 20 years with no fires would

    Walk into the woods at Penn State's Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone
    Observatory, and it's hard to miss the science happening around you.
    Instruments and gages dot the hillsides and stream beds. Trees are numbered
    with markers and deep pits expose the layers of soil under the ground.

    The CZO is part of a National Science Foundation-funded project to study
    the thin, outer layer of Earth that sustains all human life.
    Interdisciplinary scientists measure everything from what nutrients trees
    take from their highest leaves to what happens where soil and bedrock meet
    deep underground.

    Dozens of pieces of equipment help scientists collect geochemical,
    geomorphological, ecological, LIDAR and soil data from the site. That's a
    lot of information, and managing it is no small task.

    That's where Dan Shapich comes in. Shapich, a data manager with EESI, is
    tasked with making the voluminous information gathered at the site
    available to researchers and the public through the CZO's website, http://
    criticalzone.org/shale-hills/.

    "It's a big job," Shapich said.

    Since starting at EESI in October, Shapich has been working with research
    assistant Brandon Forsythe to streamline how data is collected at the CZO,
    and in updating the website.

    "We are streamlining the data so it can go directly from the sensors right
    to our servers and be automatically displayed without us having to go out
    there manually and download it," Shapich said.

    That will help researchers get their information faster, and ensure the
    data they collect is online and available to the public.

    Shapich previously worked as a programmer in the College of Engineering. He
    received his undergraduate degree in Information Science Technology and his
    master's degree in Geospatial Intelligence from Penn State.

    He said he was drawn to EESI because of the data being collected at the CZO
    and the flexibility offered by the position.

    Jaclyn Stimely quickly learned that the space grant program isn't just
    about astronomy and physics.

    "Our programming really is cross-disciplinary," said Stimely, who has been
    the administrative manager for the NASA Pennsylvania Space Grant Consortium
    (PSGC), housed within Penn State's Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute, since December. The PSGC is one of 52 across the country.

    Space Grant programming is aimed at helping future scientists and engineers
    pursue their passions. Stimely knows that can be a truly interdisciplinary
    endeavor.

    "We supported an early career biologist at St. Francis University who
    didn't have funding to continue her research through the summer," Stimely
    said. "She studied micro-organisms and the investigation of life in extreme
    environments."

    Perhaps that project stuck out for another reason. In college, Stimely
    studied biology at Arcadia University outside Philadelphia. When she
    relocated to the area, Stimely joined the Chemistry Department at Penn
    State, managing the graduate program. She accepted a job with the Space
    Grant program in December 2015.

    "It's a rewarding position," she said. "I get to work with different
    institutional programs across the state from the proposal stage to budget
    adjustments to program evaluation."

    PSGC provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at 15
    universities across the state, including Penn State. The Space Grant
    programs include scholarships, fellowships and hands-on lab experiences.
    The work crosses colleges, drawing participants in Agricultural Sciences,
    Earth and Mineral Sciences, Eberly College of Science, Education,
    Engineering, Liberal Arts, Information Sciences and Technology, and Health
    and Human Development.

    Among those programs is the Women in Science and Engineering (WISER) and
    the Minority Undergraduate Research Experience (MURE). These programs
    provide opportunities to women and minorities, matching them with
    professors in STEM research. The current cohort includes 50 participating

    Terry Noll has seen a lot of Pennsylvania.

    The Penn State research assistant's work has taken her from the
    endless-mountain wilderness of Sullivan County, to the sweeping farmlands
    of Lancaster County, to the former coal country of Indiana County.

    One thing these diverse areas have in common: rural communities grappling
    with sudden changes and complex issues brought on by the Marcellus shale
    gas boom.

    And Noll has been there to talk them through it.

    For the last four years, Noll has served as project coordinator for an
    effort to educate rural Pennsylvanians about the changes taking place in
    their backyards.

    Her work has been part of Marcellus Matters: Engaging Adults in Science and
    Energy, a National Science Foundation-funded project that since 2012 has
    educated people in rural communities about science and energy through the
    lens of Marcellus Shale natural gas development.

    "Our project is geared toward providing the education to community members
    to empower them to develop the knowledge and critical thinking skills that
    will allow them to engage in civil dialogue within their communities as
    development occurs," Noll said.

    The program, which is winding down and ends in December, has reached
    hundreds in Clearfield, Clinton, Sullivan, Indiana, Lancaster and Lycoming
    counties.

    Interdisciplinary researchers from geosciences, arts and architecture,
    agricultural sciences and education traveled to the communities and taught
    residents about everything from the physical science behind unconventional
    shale gas drilling to the social and economic impacts of an energy boom and
    bust cycle.

    "I loved the interdisciplinary approach," said Noll, who led multiple-week
    programs in the communities. "We had landscape architects who understood
    impacts on land, geologists who taught about the science behind drilling,

    On any given day, you might find Brandon Forsythe trekking through the
    woods, wading in a babbling stream or paddling out on a lake.

    It might sound like a peaceful vacation, but for Brandon it's another day
    in the office.

    Brandon, an EESI research assistant, is responsible for maintaining the
    many instruments, gages and sensors out in the field that make up Penn
    State's Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory.

    It's no small task. There are hundreds of pieces of equipment in the CZO,
    located in Penn State's Stone Valley Forest. The technology measures
    everything from metrological and atmospheric parameters all the way down to
    measurements deep under the soil.

    There's a lot of equipment, and even more data being collected, aimed at
    better our understanding of the "critical zone," the thin outer layer of
    Earth that sustains life. The interdisciplinary work looks at the impact of
    water as it move from the canopy of trees through the top layer of the
    earth into the bedrock below, including the chemistry of those
    interactions.

    It's the collaborative nature of the project that drew Brandon to Penn
    State.

    "I like the interdisciplinary approach of this position," he said. "That
    was one of my biggest draws. There's a lot more involvement, lots of
    opportunities to learn."

    Brandon received his degree from Alaska Pacific University and worked for
    the US Geological Survey in Alaska conducting stream gaging and water
    quality sampling projects in that state. He later worked for the USGS in
    Pennsylvania before coming to Penn State.

    Nooreen Meghani is on the hunt for orphaned and abandoned wells.

    She got off to a good start on a recent trip to the Allegheny National
    Forest, finding a well long forgotten in the dark woods.

    "It's was like a treasure hunt," she said.

    That's one down – a couple hundred thousand to go. There are an estimated
    200,000 of these oil and gas wells scattered across Pennsylvania.

    Finding them is a big job, and that's why Meghani is turning to citizen
    scientists for some help. She is leading the charge to recruit volunteers
    who can be trained to research where wells might be, find them and monitor
    for potential environmental impacts.

    Nooereen Meghani at a well

     

    An estimated 325,000 wells have been drilled in Pennsylvania since 1859,
    when an oil boom began in the western part of the state. Almost 100 years
    elapsed before regulations in 1956 required wells to be documented, and the
    state only has record of about 125,000.

    With no records, it's difficult to find the remaining wells and to assess
    what kind of condition they are in. If damaged or not properly sealed,
    these wells pose environmental risks, both from greenhouse gases like
    methane that can escape into the atmosphere and from oil or gas that could
    affect freshwater aquifers.

    "On one hand, you are excited to look for these things," Meghani said.
    "Then you stop and think about what it is you're finding. One of the wells
    we found was shattered and there was just a piece of concrete sticking out
    of the ground. It's a little disturbing."

    Penn State is offering new tools to aid in the search - a forum to bring
    community members together and a website that can be used to document found
    wells and track data like well integrity at the surface. The information
    can be used to inform state Department of Environmental Protection

    EESI is one of the nation's leading earth and environmental science
    research institutes, and its diverse, renowned faculty is engaged in
    innovative studies on some of the most compelling issues of our time.

    But how do those researchers share their findings with the public and get
    the word out about the work they are doing? That's where Matt Carroll comes
    in. Matt is a writer who joined EESI in fall 2014. It's his job to write
    compelling and understandable stories based on the often complex research
    being done in EESI and to help publicize the institute.

    Matt will tackle a wide range of topics being studied by EESI scientists:
    the impact of climate change on glaciers in the Antarctic, and by
    extension, rising sea levels; the importance of wetlands; effective ways to
    measure greenhouse gas emissions; the potential for natural gas development
    in the Marcellus Shale region and the best ways to assess the potential
    impacts on water quality; how climate change can affect wildfires; and the
    potential for finding other habitable planets.

    "There's no shortage of fascinating stories in EESI," Matt said. "It's my
    passion to share important stories, and I know working with our researchers
    will give me to opportunity to do just that."

    Prior to joining EESI, Matt worked for several years as a reporter at the
    Centre Daily Times, where he worked a variety of beats, covering Penn State
    University, municipal and county governments and crime and courts.

    Penn State senior research associate Tim White plunged into the ice-covered
    Susquehanna River on a snowy Sunday in March.

    Swimming in 34-degree water might sound crazy to some, but it's exactly the
    type of training White needs to keep his skills sharp.

    It's the closest he's going to get to simulating conditions in Alaska,
    where White travels most years to conduct research off the coast.

    His work there focuses on a particularly warm period in Earth's history,
    the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, and what it can tell us about our
    future.

    Approximately 55 million years ago, during the PETM, the Earth was nearly
    free of icy glaciers and alligators could be found crawling in northern
    Greenland, White said.

    "By a fairly large group of scientists, it's thought to be the closest
    analogy to where the Earth is headed in the next 500 years or so," he said.
    "It was a very warm time, when all the information that we're capable of
    gathering suggests there was very little if any polar ice ... ."

    But bits of sediment found in the fossil record lead White think there may
    have been ice on the ocean after all, at least seasonally.

    If so, it could mean at least some ice formed on the ocean during a time
    when many believe there was little, if any, on the planet.

    "We really want to nail this stuff and be able to inform decision-makers in
    an accurate way," he said. "We need to be really confident in our
    reconstructions."

    Science, a topic difficult to understand for many. One of EESI's goals in
    the 2008-2014 strategic plan was hiring an interdisciplinary program
    coordinator/ professional writer to help EESI spread information about the
    work of EMS faculty and students in the environmental sciences.

    That's where Anne Danahy comes in. She is a writer who joined EESI in fall
    2012. She has a talent for creating fascinating understandable stories even
    if the topic is complex. Her repertoire is far-reaching. She writes about
    droughts and fires in the Amazon, about habitable planets,
    paleoceanography, birds and their environment, fracking and gas well
    flowback, politics, poverty, climate change and many more topics. She not
    only interviews scientists but also university presidents and trustees,
    school teachers and students and regular citizens.

    "One of the favorite parts of my job is talking with scientists and their
    students and learning about the research they're doing," Anne said. "Last
    week, I got to have a FaceTime chat with one researcher while he was on a
    summer program in Alaska, and go watch another researcher and his students
    do field work on vernal pools."

    In 2013 Anne was the recipient of the College of Earth and Mineral
    Sciences' Future Star Award. In addition to her job as science writer she
    teaches news writing and is a volunteer host of a Q&A program on the local
    cable television access station, C-NET.

    Prior to joining ESSI, Anne worked for about 12 years as a reporter at the
    Centre Daily Times.

    May 2014

    Space grant programs at 13 universities, special scholarships for students
    and research awards for astrobiologists.

    Linda Bell has a hand in it all.

    Bell is administrative manager for the NASA Pennsylvania Space Grant
    Consortium and the Penn State Astrobiology Research Center, both of which
    are housed within the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute. The Space
    Grant program, aimed at helping future scientists and engineers pursue
    their passions, marked its 25th anniversary in 2013. In that year alone,
    the Pennsylvania program that Bell helps run awarded grants to about 400
    undergraduate and graduate students.

    Bell handles the budgeting from the beginning to the end, including
    proposals, making sure the plans stay on track, overseeing spending and
    trouble-shooting questions from students, faculty and staff. That could be
    students looking for guidance on their scholarships or faculty on the other
    side of the world running into trouble getting the freight they need for
    their research off a boat.

    "I enjoy working with the professors," Bell said. "I love collaborating
    with them and getting ideas. It's absolutely amazing what some of these
    consortia are doing. To go to national centers, like Goddard, and see what
    they're doing is absolutely mind blowing."

    The Pennsylvania Space Grant program is one of 52 across the country. The
    Space Grant programs include scholarship, fellowships and lab work for
    students at Penn State and other schools around the state. The work crosses
    colleges, drawing participants in Earth and Mineral Sciences, Education,
    Liberal Arts, Engineering and Health and Human Development.

    Among those programs is the Women in Science and Engineering Program
    (WISER), which matches female undergraduates at Penn State main campus,
    Altoona and Abington, Temple University and Gannon University with
    professors in science and engineering. About 80 professors are
    participating in this program.

    Before the grants and contracts that support research projects in the Earth
    and Environmental Systems Institute can be submitted, many have to cross
    Brad King's desk.

    Now, as part of a six-month administrative fellowship, King, associate
    coordinator of grants and contracts, is learning about what happens once
    faculty and researchers are awarded funding from federal, state and
    industry sponsors.

    "In my job, I'm on the other end of the spectrum. I deal with everything
    until we get the award or grant," said King, whose position is with the
    Associate Dean for Graduate Education and Research Office in the College of
    Earth and Mineral Sciences. "What made me want to do this administrative
    fellowship was to see what they're doing with the grant once they got it."

    Through the EMS fellowship program, staff interested in expanding their
    expertise by working with mentors in other offices and units can apply to
    become fellows. King is working with Deb Detwiler, the administrative
    assistant in EESI who coordinates research proposals and administers grant
    awards; and Tracy Bernier, administrative assistant to EESI Director Sue
    Brantley.

    "I wanted to broaden my administrative knowledge, and I think learning the
    post-award side of things will help me help the researchers on the
    pre-award side too," King said.

    On average for the past three years, EESI faculty and researchers have
    submitted 66 proposals a year. That funding supports research across a
    range of subjects from the behavior of ice sheets in the Antarctic to
    ancient leaves buried in forests and streams. Current EESI projects include
    a $12 million National Science Foundation award for the Sustainable Climate
    Risk Management initiative, and $5 million from the NSF for the Susquehanna
    Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory.

    King started his job in EMS in November 2010 after graduating from Penn
    State with a bachelor's in labor studies and employment relations. He had
    at one point majored in professional golf management — but found that
    wasn't his calling.

    In the past few years, interest has grown concerning the "habitable zone"
    around the Sun and other stars. The habitable zone is the region in space
    where a rocky planet similar to Earth can maintain liquid water on its
    surface. We define it that way because life — all life that we know about,
    at least — requires liquid water during at least part of its life cycle.

    This topic has heated up in the last few years because NASA's Kepler Space
    Telescope has been counting planets in the habitable zones of other stars.
    Kepler monitored the brightness of approximately 160,000 stars continuously
    from 2009 to 2013, ending when it lost a critical reaction wheel
    (gyroscope) and could no longer point accurately. During that time, Kepler
    detected over 3,500 planets orbiting more than 2,600 stars. Kepler found
    planets by looking for the slight decrease in a star's brightness when a
    planet passes in front of it. Of the 3,500 detected objects, about two
    dozen are rocky planets orbiting within the habitable zones of their parent
    star.

    Fresh fruit? How about a 52.2 million-year-old tomatillo.

    That's what Peter Wilf, professor of geosciences and an EESI associate,
    found as part of his work in Argentina. Information on the discovery caught
    the attention of the media when Wilf presented it at the Geological Society
    of America meeting in Denver.

    "Though flattened, the ancient fruit ... looks remarkably like a modern
    version of the popular salsa ingredient," Live Science notes in a story
    about the finding.

    The discovery is part of the work Wilf, professor of geosciences at Penn
    State, and other researchers are doing in Laguna del Hunco in Argentina.

    "There's so much left to discover," Wilf remarked in a radio interview with
    KPCC on the topic.

    Conducting research presents challenges, but turning the data into
    understandable information can be its own puzzle.

    Cyberspecialist Dan Arthur joined EESI in May to work with faculty and
    researchers on doing that - finding ways to make their research and data
    accessible to others. That includes working with the Susquehanna Shale
    Hills Critical Zone Observatory project on data management, data
    presentation and promoting CZO activities.

    A recent example is the animated graphic that shows the Penn State
    Integrated Hydrologic Model. The model is used to predict soil saturation
    levels in the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone, a federally funded
    research initiative.

    Before joining EESI, Arthur worked at Purdue University as a graduate
    research assistant in atmospheric science, and before that, he was
    worldwide support manager for broadcast editing and webcasting products at
    Pinnacle Systems Inc.

    He spent 15 years in video production, support and management for
    manufacturing of broadcast video editing hardware. Arthur also has
    experience in software applications and data management.

    He has a master's degree in information and communication science from Ball
    State University and a master's in atmospheric science from Purdue. His
    atmospheric science research involved simultaneous visualization of radar
    and aircraft probe data - which are very different in scale - in 3D, as
    well as using numerical models and field observations to investigate cloud
    and precipitation processes.

    In his current position, Arthur can work with faculty and researchers on
    projects such as creating educational and promotional videos, database
    management, generating computerized plots and assisting with creating
    visual representation of data.

    If a community wanted to cut its greenhouse gas emissions and decided to
    take steps to do it, how would it know if the steps it was taking worked?

    A team of researchers from Penn State's College of Earth and Mineral
    Sciences and several other universities has been testing a method for doing
    that, by capturing readings of greenhouse gases in an urban atmosphere.
    Known as INFLUX, The Indianapolis Flux Experiment uses a combination of
    measurements taken on towers and readings from aircraft to find out how
    much carbon dioxide and methane is being emitted from the city.

    "It is an independent way to quantify emissions levels and later validate
    changes and reductions. We hope to demonstrate this and learn what is
    required to make this work," said Ken Davis, professor of meteorology at
    Penn State and a lead researcher on the project.

    The results are expected to provide data that could be used to establish
    standards for measuring greenhouse gas emissions. The project will document
    the accuracy of the method, and establish open data records that will allow
    for independent verification of the findings.

    The Penn State team's part of the project includes deploying and operating
    the sensors that are distributed across the metropolitan region on 12
    communications towers and are designed to measure the greenhouse gases
    carbon dioxide and methane. The towers also host measurements of carbon
    monoxide and other tracers of industrial activity to help identify the
    sources of the greenhouse gases. That data is being coupled with
    measurements taken during 40 flights over the area and with information
    about buildings and their estimated individual energy usage.

    Davis said the expression "the atmosphere can't lie" is true in cases like
    this where the atmosphere records the earth's emissions. The tower-based
    sensors offer an independent way to measure changes in emissions, including
    whether reductions are taking place.

    Davis explained that this method is really quite simple: As air flows
    across the city, emissions accumulate in the atmosphere. By measuring this
    accumulation and quantifying the wind speed and atmospheric mixing, the
    researchers can infer the emission rates.

    Who could find fault with Smokey the Bear, the gentle Ursus whose advice
    many Americans grew up following? Perhaps the spotted owl, for starters. To
    flourish, the endangered bird that's native to the western United States
    needs certain types of forests that aren't found in places where severe
    wildfires have occurred.

    Smokey, of course, encourages people to take steps to prevent fires, not
    start them. But, suppression of naturally occurring blazes can have
    unintended consequences. Whether those include increasing the possibility
    for wildfires to become severe has been the focus of research Alan Taylor,
    Penn State professor of geography, recently completed.

    Taylor's study focused on a mixed conifer forest in part of the Lassen
    National Forest in northern California known as the Cub Creek Research
    Natural Area that was the site of a wildfire in 2008. The unusual history
    of that preserved area that has never been logged allowed Taylor to look at
    whether a forest would burn the same way in two different time periods:
    one, in the 1880s, before fire suppression policy took effect, and the
    other in 2008 after it was being practiced.

    Taylor said that, in general, the burning patterns were similar, but with
    an important difference.

    "We lost more of the forest in the valley bottom because of the changes
    caused by fire suppression," Taylor said. "We lost 20 to 25 percent more
    than expected of the large, older growth trees."

    What the research found, through a combination of analyzing satellite data
    and field measurements, is that the high severity portions of the 2008 fire
    affected not only younger forests on upper slopes and ridgetops where they
    had burned severely in the 19th century but older more diverse forests in
    the valleys that had escaped high severity fire in the past. Tree ring
    dating of fire scars show that forests in the valley had burned many times
    in the past 300 years but not severely.

    "Historically, fires operated in a way that tended to be less severe in
    valley bottoms and lower slopes," Taylor said. "Now, because of fire
    suppression, they tend to burn at a higher severity and you lose that
    habitat."

    A 100 foot core extracted from the south ridge of the Shale Hills CZO
    catchment in central Pennsylvania was one of the items on display at Penn
    State's Earth and Environmental Systems Institute recently during this
    year's Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory "All Hands"
    meeting.

    The Penn State project – known as SSHCZO – is focused on a section of Stone
    Valley in Huntingdon County. It's part of a National Science Foundation
    initiative aimed at understanding the "critical zone" – the Earth's outer
    skin that sustains life.

    The May meeting of faculty, students and post-doctorate researchers who are
    part of the Penn State project included an opening seminar by invited guest
    Kip Solomon, a groundwater hydrologist at the University of Utah,
    presentations on the latest research and a poster session. The core on hand
    was drilled from a section of the Rose Hill Shale and will provide
    researchers with a way to investigate the chemistry and mineralogy of that
    section of earth and how it changed over time.

    Other presentations this year included observations of the groundwater
    beneath the Shale Hills CZO; a profile of shale soil, micrometeorology at
    Shale Hills and a new approach to quantifying the pore structure of rocks.

    "The 'All Hands' meeting gives the faculty, students and post-doctorates
    who are part of the CZO a chance to share their recent activities and
    findings with each other and discuss their new ideas and next steps," said
    Jennifer Williams, a research assistant at Penn State and program and data
    coordinator of SSHCZO.

    The SSHCZO includes nine faculty, five post-doctoral researchers, eight
    graduate students and three undergraduates. It is one of six projects that
    are part of the national initiative.

    David Pollard's work is taking him back in time five million years, not
    only to learn about the past but also what could be coming in the future.

    Pollard, a senior scientist in Penn State's Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute, is developing computer programs that can model the behavior of
    ice sheets in the past, and from that gain insight into what upcoming
    generations could see.

    "Understanding how ice sheets have responded in the past can help to
    predict how they will respond to future warming and contribute to sea level
    rise and flooding," Pollard said.

    The computer model Pollard created simulates how the Antarctic ice sheet
    has advanced and retreated over the last 5 million years. He notes that one
    sector, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, rests on bedrock far below sea level
    and is particularly vulnerable to warming ocean temperatures. The model
    code describes not only the current characteristics of the ice sheet – such
    as the velocity of ice flow and temperatures of the ice – but also
    simulates how the ice extent and thickness change over time.

    To assess the accuracy of the model, Pollard, along with Robert DeConto, a
    professor at the University of Massachusetts, compared its results to
    actual geological data from the multinational ANDRILL project gathered by
    drilling into sediments below floating ice fringing West Antarctica. The
    natural variations of the ice sheet simulated by the model corresponded
    well with the stacked layers in the sediment cores over the last 5 million
    years, allowing scientists to expand the relevance of the data beyond the
    local drill site to the entire region of West Antarctica.

    Now, Pollard is focusing the model on a smaller region of the West
    Antarctic coast that includes Pine Island Glacier, an area where the ice
    has begun to dramatically thin and flow faster in recent decades. By
    zooming in on a small region, the spacing between model grid points can be
    finer, improving the details of the simulations. Other researchers at Penn
    State and elsewhere are also paying close attention to Pine Island and
    nearby glaciers (http://live.psu.edu/story/63448 -- Link expired).

    Pollard's model includes the warming effects of both ocean and atmospheric
    temperatures. Ocean temperatures affect the ice via floating ice shelves —

    December 2012

    Sridhar Anandakrishnan is away for the winter holiday, somewhere summer is
    in full swing -- an ice sheet at the end of the earth.

    The Penn State professor of geosciences is leading the University team
    that's part of a project on the Pine Island Glacier, an extension of the
    Antarctic ice sheet. The goal of the National Science Foundation-funded
    initiative is to get a better understanding of how the glacier, the ocean
    and the ice shelf are interacting, and what that could mean if water
    temperatures rise.

    The project includes teams from NASA, the University of Alaska, New York
    University, the Naval Postgraduate School and the British Antarctic Survey.
    It's the first of its kind to focus on the Pine Island Glacier, a remote
    region that can only be reached a few months a year in an airplane that
    lands on skis.

    "It's a pretty spectacular spot," Anandakrishnan, a faculty member in Penn
    State's Earth and Environmental Systems Institute, said before leaving
    campus to join doctoral student Kiya Riverman and research associate Leo
    Peters, who are part of his team.

    Riverman and Peters arrived at the site – literally a camp on the ice –
    after Thanksgiving. If the weather cooperates, Anandakrishnan is traveling
    first to McMurdo Base on Ross Island and from there will communicate with
    the team at Pine Island Glacier.

    An ice shelf is an extension of the Antarctic ice sheet, but, unlike the
    ice sheet, ocean water flows in the cavity underneath the shelf.
    Anandakrishnan compared the cycle of melting and freezing that goes on to a
    bank account: Snowfall gradually adds to the glacier, which in turn flows
    out to the ocean, leading to "withdrawals" from the account. When it snows,
    more ice goes back into the bank account.

    "If the cycle is nicely balanced, everybody is happy," he said.

    But if more ice flows out into the ocean than snow goes back into the
    glacier, that means a rise in the sea level. If temperatures climb, one
    possibility is that the melting ice shelves – floating extensions of the
    ice sheet – will shrink and provide less of a buffer between the ocean and

    and regularly speaks at conferences. He enjoys lecturing on oceanography,
    meteorology, and world geography and was named the "2012 Altoona College
    Outstanding Lecturer".

    Bernd has served on numerous proposal-writing teams and acquired
    substantial external funding to support my academic interests. His skills
    in programming, numerical ocean and climate modeling, and technology have
    benefited researchers and students from EMS as well as those he collaborate
    with across campus and throughout the academic community. In particular,
    Bernd has been collaborating for the past couple of years with faculty at
    Penn State Institutes of the Environment on several projects. These
    projects, which encompass varying aspects of research, outreach, and
    teaching include developing geospatial analysis tools and GIS map services
    for NOAA/NWS climate data, integrating fisheries data with hydrologic and
    geographic data for the State of Maryland, and joint projects funded by the
    U.S. Geological Survey to develop publicly accessible Chesapeake Bay and
    Delaware Estuary visualization and analysis tools and the FAA NoiseQuest
    program. The overall goals of these projects are to further scientific
    investigation into the region, educate students and citizens about the
    estuaries and oceans, and to provide tools for teaching.

    For a little bit over three years Bernd joint a group of scientists from
    PSU's meteorology department working on the Chequamegon
    Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (ChEAS), a multi-organizational research effort
    studying biosphere/atmosphere interactions within a northern mixed forest
    in Northern Wisconsin as well as high-precision, high-accuracy CO[2] mixing
    ratio measurements in collaboration with Ameriflux towers and support of
    the INFLUX (INdianapolis FLUX) program.

    Besides his daily research Bernd is working on acquiring global patent
    rights on oil confinement since there is a need not only for oil

    Research Services

    The Institute endeavors to develop initiatives or centers that focus on
    compelling scientific, social, and engineering issues and problems that
    require the expertise of more than a single researcher or even a single
    department. The expertise and strengths of academic departments in the
    College of Earth and Mineral Sciences often provide the foundation for
    these interdisciplinary initiatives and centers. The resources of the Earth
    and Environmental Systems Institute are designed to create added
    opportunities for faculty and students and to act as a catalyst for
    innovative, collaborative research.

    Faculty Services

    The Institute provides high-quality support services through its budget and
    grant management personnel, computing assistance through its Environmental
    Computing Facility, and outreach support through its outreach support teams
    and Center for Environmental Informatics. Proposal development, external
    funding opportunities searches, and editorial assistance are available to
    Institute faculty as well.

    Student Services

    Through its projects, data resources, and collaborative linkages, the
    Institute supports students interested in earth science and environmental
    research. Students gain valuable experience working as research assistants
    on Institute projects; often the research performed for a funded project
    stimulates a student's interest in the area under study, resulting in a
    thesis or dissertation project, and in co-authored publications. Through
    their work on Institute projects, students also have opportunities to
    "network", or make professional contacts that guide them as they make
    career decisions and look for employment. The Institute contributes to the
    College of Earth and Mineral Science’s broader educational mission by
    sponsoring speakers, seminar series, and other events in cooperation with
    other Penn State units.

    EESI High Performance Computing Resource

    For the last ten years now EESI has offered priority access to large high
    performance computing resources subsidized by various funded research
    efforts and run through the Research Computing and Cyberinfrastructure
    group (formerly known as GEaRs).

    Lion-xo remains available well past the orginally intended end of its
    operational life. This resource was primarily funded by the now defunct
    Center for Environmental Kinetic Analysis (CEKA).

    Lion-XC is still in the prime of its operational life and should be
    available for several more years. This resource was funded by the Earth
    System Science Center and EESI.

    And Lion-XF is the newest HPC cluster that was brought online in 2012. This
    resource was funded by David Pollard and EESI. Lion-XF will be available
    only to a limited number of researchers.

    EESI associates who are interested in using these HPC resources may request
    access through John Miley.

    These collaborations have been highly successful and on average we have had
    more computing capacity than we could consume.

    For the future, individual researchers with small scale HPC needs are
    encouraged to contact the RCC high performance computing group directly to
    discuss how you can work with that group to best meet your needs: https://
    ics.psu.edu/about/

    This contact will typically result in a meeting with the HPC group's
    director who can then advise you on how to best spend your grant money. If
    you choose to spend your research dollars with them and become a partner
    you will still receive priority access to whatever cluster you buy into and
    you will get exceptional support.

    If you have an existing relationship with us for HPC from a grant funded
    prior to 2009, nothing has changed for you. You may continue just as you
    have been until that grant is gone or you no longer require access. If you
    have any potential future large scale HPC needs we'd like to talk to you
    about how we might be able to work together and subsidize your efforts for
    the good of our local computing community.

    EESI Centers and Initiatives

    Overview

    Faculty-driven and directed, EESI centers are leaders in interdisciplinary,
    collaborative and innovative research in the ever-changing environmental
    sciences. Researchers involved with the centers are engaged in
    understanding the earth system, how it affects people and how people affect
    it.

    EESI centers and initiatives promote, conduct and coordinate
    interdisciplinary research and educational activities within environmental
    sciences/engineering/social sciences. Centers or initiatives are selected
    in a competitive process that occurs every three years. Centers receive
    funding awards from EESI from $5,000 to $15,000 per year for their
    activities.

    The last call for center proposals occurred in Spring 2017 with the centers
    below funded. The next call for proposals will occur in 2020. For more

    2017 EESI Call for Center Proposals

    Call for Center Proposals

    Earth and Environmental Systems Institute (EESI)

    Due date: April 17, 2017

     

    Call for Proposals for Centers

    We seek proposals from EESI associates for new Initiatives or Centers, and
    renewal proposals for existing Centers within EESI. Proposers are
    encouraged to read the University guidelines (RAG05) concerning Center
    status on EESI's website (https://policy.psu.edu/policies/RAG05).
    Initiatives should be proposed especially for activities that are likely to
    be eligible to become Centers as described by the university guidelines.

    What is an EESI Center or an EESI Initiative?

    A Center or Initiative within EESI represents a focus of interdisciplinary
    research and educational activities fostered by EESI associates and
    affiliates. In general, such a focus generally starts as an Initiative
    (this step can be approved by the EESI Director) and then progresses to
    become a Center (the step must be approved by the Senior Vice President for
    Research). Current Centers/Initiatives that are receiving EESI funding
    include the Center for Climate Risk Management (CLIMA), Center for
    Environmental Informatics (CEI), Earth System Science Center (ESSC), Penn
    State Ice and Climate Research Center (PSICE), Center for Landscape
    Dynamics (CLD), Energy and Environmental Economics and Policy Initiative
    (EEEP), and Riparia. These Centers receive anywhere from $5000 to $15,000
    per year for Center activities. Centers target one or more of the following
    goals over the three-year lifetime of the Center:

      □ promote interaction among faculty, students, and staff in a growing
        interdisciplinary field within the environmental sciences/engineering/
        social sciences
      □ promote excellence in scientific research, especially aligned with
        EESI's strategic plan
      □ promote access to computers, analytical instrumentation, or field sites
      □ foster the securing of extramural funding for multi-PI projects
      □ promote educational opportunities for students in environmental
        sciences and engineering, with special attention to udents from
        under-represented groups

    (EEEP)

    Initiative for Energy and Environmental Economics and Policy (EEEP)

    Co-Directors: Seth Blumsack and Karen Fisher-Vanden

    The Initiative for Energy and Environmental Economics and Policy (EEEP) was
    established in 2011 with the goal of promoting policy-relevant economics
    research that lies at the boundary between economic sciences and the study
    of natural or engineered systems. The EEEP initiative is focused primarily
    on the union between energy systems and environmental management and the
    development of quantitative tools to address decision challenges in these
    areas. As an initiative, our goal is to catalyze research in energy and
    environmental systems economics across the University and to build a
    world-class group of economists with interests in interdisciplinary
    collaboration.

    EEEP operates as a University-wide initiative with support provided by the
    Earth and Environmental Systems Institute, Penn State Institutes for Energy
    and the Environment, and the Environment and Natural Resources Institute.

    Examples of research in energy and environmental systems economics at Penn
    State include:

      □ electricity markets, the smart grid, integrating renewable electricity,
        and cyber-security in energy infrastructures;
      □ economic impacts and risks associated with global climate change;
      □ the design and implementation of energy-efficient building systems;
      □ valuation of ecosystem services;
      □ implications of Marcellus Shale natural gas development for energy
        markets and environmental quality;
      □ global markets for rare earth minerals.

    EEEP activities include a periodic seminar series featuring internal and
    external speakers, and an Initiative Affiliate program for students and
    faculty. Affiliates are eligible for small research and travel grants from
    the Initiative.

    EESI Centers and Initiatives

    Environmental Student Ambassador (ESA) Program

    EESI is seeking EMS undergraduate students interested in enhancing
    environmental stewardship and outreach in the University community and
    beyond to become Environmental Student Ambassadors.

    Funds are available to support the activities of an ESA by applying with a
    faculty sponsor in your EMS department. ESAs will be selected on the basis
    of a proposed project that improves the health and sustainability of the
    environment for the local community, for EMS, or for the University. The
    projects could, but are not required to, be executed in collaboration with
    University units (e.g. Physical Plant, the Arboretum at Penn State),
    student clubs (e.g. Ecoaction), community groups (e.g. ClearWater
    Conservancy, Millbrook Marsh), or an environmental group (e.g. Nature
    Conservancy, SIerra Club). Projects could focus on, for example, developing
    new educational or outreach materials for the public, improving the carbon
    footprint, recycling, energy audits, or removing invasive species in
    conservation areas.

    Environmental Student Ambassadors will receive financial and staff support
    for their activities for a semester but longer projects will be considered.

    Student ambassadors will need a faculty sponsor who is willing to serve as
    a mentor during the implementation of the project. The ESA could become
    part of a student curriculum by registering for independent study credits
    in consultation with their faculty mentor. ESAs are also expected to share
    project results with the EESI community at an informal lunch.

    EESI has allocated $2,500 annually to support the activities of the ESA
    program. Salary support will not be provided for the ESA. Acknowledgment of

    EESI Centers and Initiatives

    Scholar in Resident (SIR) Faculty Program

    The Scholar in Residence (SIR) for EMS faculty is a professional
    advancement grant in research or teaching for outstanding EESI Associates
    and Affiliates. The Departments of the recipients receive support for a
    semester to allow the Associate to focus on the scholarship of research or
    teaching and learning in the interdisciplinary environmental sciences.
    Depending on the available support, Scholars will reside (i.e. have office
    space in) in EESI during the academic year of, or the year after, a
    successful application.

    The SIR program targets support to individuals pursuing work of strategic
    interest to EESI as outlined in the EESI Strategic Plan. EESI offers
    $10,000 to the department of the Scholar-in-Residence to release each
    recipient from all classroom teaching responsibilities for the semester in
    exchange for residence in EESI. The SIR recipient must be in residence in
    the Earth and Engineering Science Building during the semester. During the
    award period, the recipient will also serve in an advisory capacity to the
    Director of the Institute.

    An acknowledgement of the SIR in any publications or material developed for
    distribution is expected (e.g. research was undertaken when the author was
    an EESI Scholar-in-Residence (January-July, 2010).

     

    How to Apply

    Applicants should submit a statement describing the proposed work
    (including the timing) and how a SIR grant would contribute to these
    activities, their most current curriculum vitae, a letter of support from
    their department head, and their most current faculty activity report.
    Individuals are encouraged to contact Susan L. Brantley (sxb7@psu.edu) to
    discuss their plan for use of a SIR before developing their proposal. The
    application for a SIR can be submitted by mail or email to Susan L.
    Brantley (sxb7@psu.edu), Director, Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute, 2217 EES, Penn State University, University Park, PA 16802.

    EESI Centers and Initiatives

    Funding for Workshops

    EESI will provide funding for short focused workshops to enable groups of
    researchers to interact to move key ideas forward to increase the impact of
    research programs or to position research programs to lead in emerging
    areas of interdisciplinary environmental science. In its role as a leading
    environmental institute, EESI is well-positioned to facilitate workshops
    that support the research programs of our EESI Associates and Affiliates.

    Workshop structure:

    EESI seeks proposals from EESI Associates to run small workshops to support
    their research programs. Workshop proposals can fall into one of three
    categories:

     1. Proposals for scientific workshops that are tightly focused. Topics
        should be both timely and of interest to a group of EESI Associates and
        Affiliates that reside in different academic units at Penn State, and
        to scientists at other institutions.
     2. Proposals for workshops designed to bring together a group of
        prospective PIs to develop multi-disciplinary research proposals.
     3. Proposals for workshops supported by extramural funds that will utilize
        EESI facilities or EESI staff.

    Considerable flexibility is given to how the workshops will be run.
    Workshops with the following characteristics are especially encouraged:

      □ limited duration (likely 1 – 1.5 days)
      □ focused on a disciplinary or topical area consistent with EESIs mission
      □ limited size (~20 or fewer participants)
      □ inclusive of junior researchers (senior graduate students and postdocs)
        as well as a diversity of groups

    A steering committee of at least 3 people is expected to participate in
    developing and running proposed workshops.

    EESI can fund one workshop per calendar year and any EESI Associate is
    eligible to submit a proposal. Proposals will be evaluated by the EESI
    Advisory Committee. Individuals are encouraged to contact Sue Brantley (
    brantley@essc.psu.edu) to discuss their workshop idea before developing a
    proposal. Proposals that further EESI strategic goals as summarized in the
    Strategic Plan, proposals that involve multiple EESI Associates, and
    proposals that are co-sponsored by other units on campus are particularly
    encouraged.

    Research - Data Management Plan

    Data Management Plan

    Many agencies are now requiring more formal data management plans than in
    the past. These include:

      □ Office of Science and Technology Policy - The White House
          ☆ Expanding Public Access to the Results of Federally Funded Research
      □ National Science Foundation (NSF) Data Management Plan Requirements
      □ NASA Data Management Plan Guidance
      □ National Institutes of Health - NIH

    This page is designed to assist PI's in developing data management plans to
    support an otherwise successful proposal. This page is for guidance only
    and does not necessarily grant success. We welcome comments and feedback to
    help us ensure that the information here is up-to-date.

    Information provided here includes:

      □ available data repositories (predominantly those on campus),
      □ contacts who can provide help a PI to identify project-specific needs
        for data storage,
      □ generally asked questions about data storage, and
      □ advice on how to support someone who is helping to develop the data
        management plan and/or responsible for the data management during the
        life of the project.

    In many cases, it also helps to get an example data management plan (from a
    successfully funded proposal!).

    Purchasing Card Questions and Answers

    Q: How will I know if my p-card expenses require a p-card support form or
    will be included as part of my travel expenses?

    A: A good way to check is by logging into ERS and reviewing your imported
    expenses. These expenses will normally be included as part of a travel or
    meal reimbursement report and require either a travel reimbursement
    worksheet or a group meal/meeting form.

    Q: When I register for a conference or workshop on my p-card, do I need to
    complete a p-card support form for this expense even though it is part of
    my conference expenses? Why is this not part of the travel form that I
    submit after completion of my trip?

    A: The expenses are filtered either into the ERS System or into the IBIS
    Financial System, based on the merchant code of the vendor. Normally,
    vendors who coordinate the registrations, have a merchant code that the
    system filters into the IBIS system which requires a p-card support form.

    2019 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    Registration open for 2019 Shale Network Workshop

    March 2019

    Shale Network drill pad photoThe workshop will be held May 16 and 17 at the
    Nittany Lion Inn in State College, Pa. The theme of this year's workshop is
    "Monitoring Communities and Their Environment."

    The workshop provides an opportunity for citizen scientists, researchers,
    government officials, energy company representatives, and environmental
    professionals to compare lessons learned about water and environmental
    issues within areas where shale energy development is occurring.

    The 2019 workshop features a field trip to two shale energy-related sites
    that manage solid and liquid wastes derived from well drilling and oil and
    gas production. The first is a tour of the Eureka Resources Williamsport,
    Pa. facility, an oil and gas wastewater management plant. This facility is
    designed for the pretreatment, recycling and disposal of wastewater from
    natural gas drilling and production operations in the Marcellus and Utica
    Shales. The second is a tour of the Wayne Township Landfill in Clinton
    County, Pa. The landfill manages drilling cuttings and muds generated
    primarily from shale well drilling operations and uses some novel practices
    to minimize the industry's environmental footprint. In addition, the
    facility hosts a compressed natural gas filling station for vehicles,
    including trash hauling vehicles.

     

    Details Shale Network Workshop can be found here.

##  News Archive 2017 - Living Filter Corn Irrigation 


 
    2017 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    Living Filter Corn Irrigation

    February 2017

    UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa -- Changes in climate can rapidly impact even the
    deepest freshwater aquifers according to Penn State and Columbia University
    hydrologists.

    The researchers found that responses to climate variations can be detected
    in deep groundwater aquifers faster than expected - in many cases within a
    year.

    Living Filter Corn Irrigation

    Because rain water may take years to reach deep aquifers through natural
    infiltration, the findings suggest another factor is involved, such as
    pumping of aquifers done by agricultural industries.

    "We saw a rapid response in deep groundwater levels to both major climate
    cycles and local precipitation," said Tess Russo, associate in Penn State's
    Earth and Environmental Systems Institute. "These aquifers are so deep, we
    expect it takes years for precipitation to make its way down, so if it's
    not natural recharge causing the response of groundwater to changes in
    precipitation, then it may be coming from pumping changes."

    The research, published in Nature Geoscience, sheds new light on
    groundwater budgets in the U.S. and better defines how water held in deep
    aquifers could change with the climate. Groundwater used by municipalities
    and industry is almost always drawn from deep wells, which provide a more
    reliable source of water than shallow aquifers, especially during times of
    drought.

##  News Archive 2016 - Leaf study brings boom to CZO 


 
    2016 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    Leaf study brings boom to CZO

    October 2016

    UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa -- It wasn't hunting season, but a Penn State
    researcher took aim at the target and fired. Nothing moved except some
    leaves floating gently to the ground – a perfect shot.

    Leaf study brings boom to CZO

     

    It was those leaves that Penn State graduate student Lillian Hill and her
    team were after earlier this year when they trekked out into the woods with
    a shotgun. It may seem unusual, but it's actually a common method to bring
    down samples that grow high in the canopy – called sun leaves.

    It's those hard-to-reach leaves that Hill needs. She is studying what
    nutrients trees take from their leaves before dropping them, and what that
    process can tell us about what's happening underneath.

    "Plants suck up whatever is in the soil that they need, and they put it in
    their leaves to do the types of reactions they need to keep themselves
    going," Hill said.

    Before the leaves fall, plants resorb any nutrients they need to reserve
    for the next year. If they take back a specific nutrient, it might mean
    they are not getting enough from the soil.

    "That's why we are looking at older canopy trees, they kind of learn what
    to resorb," Hill said, whose advisors are Jason Kaye, professor of soil
    biogeochemistry, and Roman DiBiase, assistant professor of geosciences and
    associate in the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute at Penn State.

    Hill will head back out to the woods this month to collect more samples.
    Her job will be much easier, thanks to the changing seasons. Hill will take
    the live leaves she previously collected, and the dead leaves she'll find
    this fall, run them through equipment in the lab, and compare nutrient
    content.

    Her work can tell us what nutrients are missing from the soil and therefor
    what is limiting trees' growth in any particular location. This can also
    offer researchers information about the soil and bedrock underneath are
    interacting.

    Hill is comparing limiting nutrients at locations with shale bedrock and
    sandstone found within Penn State's Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone
    Observatory.

    "We're also taking soil samples out here at multiple depths and analyzing
    that for the same suite of nutrients," Hill said. "That gives us an idea if
    there is a difference in nutrient limitation between sandstone and shale.
    That's my big question."

    The sites are part of Penn State's CZO, one in a network funded by the
    National Science Foundation that links diverse geographical locations
    across the U.S. where researchers are studying the thin layer that supports
    all human life. Dr. Susan L. Brantley, Distinguished Professor of

    DOE - Penn State Collaboration

    Project to develop computational tools for coupled human-natural systems

    January 2017

    UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa -- EESI hosting new collaboration between University
    and DOE

    Klaus Keller, Chris Forest and Rob Nicholas, associates in the Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute, will take part in a new five-year, $20
    million project between Penn State, Stanford University and the U.S.
    Department of Energy (DOE).

    DOE - Penn State Collaboration

    Through the project, researchers will seek to develop an integrated
    modeling and analysis framework to assess impacts of variability and change
    in the Earth system. Co-led by Karen Fisher-Vanden (Ag Econ), the project
    involves nearly 30 Penn State collaborators across Earth and Mineral
    Sciences, Agricultural Sciences, Engineering, Eberly College of Science,
    and Penn State Law.

    EESI is hosting the project, which is co-located with the Network for
    Sustainable Climate Risk Management on the third floor office suite of the
    Earth-Engineering Science Building.

    CZO hosts Summer Scholars

    CZO Summer Scholars walk in Researchers' shoes

    September 2016

    UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa -- If you need directions around the sloping, forested
    hills near Penn State's Shaver's Creek Environmental Center, just ask
    Connor Martin.

    CZO REU Summer Scholar 2016

    Summer CZO REU students and Penn State researchers run an experiment to
    test soil infiltration rates at the Garner Run site in Penn State's
    Susquehanna Hills Critical Zone Observatory (CZO). The team hoped to
    compare the numbers to infiltration rates over rocky sections of the site.

     

    Martin spent his summer trekking through the woods -- pencil, maps and GPS
    unit in hand. He was part of a team mapping the ground cover, from soil and
    dead leaves to rocky outcroppings, of the Garner Run site in Penn State's
    Susquehanna Hills Critical Zone Observatory (CZO).

    "We have pages covered in numbers," Martin said. "One means rocky with no
    canopy, two means a complete soil mantle, and so on. We walked through the
    woods writing these numbers as we go."

    CZO REU Summer Scholar 2016His work has helped produce detailed maps of the
    site, which is part of a Nation Science Foundation-funded network of
    observatories studying the thin layer of Earth that supports human life.
    The numbers he collected could someday help lead to a better understanding
    of the geological processes that shaped the region in the past, and how the
    land surface might behave in the future.

    Martin, a geosciences student at the University of Pittsburgh, was one of
    17 undergraduates from Penn State and universities across the country who
    this year participated in the CZO summer Research Experience for
    Undergraduates and Teachers (REU/RET) program.

    The program, sponsored by the NSF and hosted by Penn State's Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute, paired students with researchers at CZO
    locations at Penn State and the Stroud Environmental Center in southeastern
    Pennsylvania and northern Delaware.

    The goal is to introduce students to the type of cross-disciplinary
    research happening in a CZO, giving them real-world experience and giving
    scientists help with their work.

    "We are getting lots of field work, lots of experience and we're putting
    some skills to the test," Martin said. "It's really cool to just think
    about the big picture, how the ecosystem and plants and soil and rocks all
    come together."

    The CZO program is a network of 10 sites in diverse geographical locations
    in the United States, along with a national office, that studies the layer
    of the Earth that stretches from the tops of trees to the deepest fresh
    groundwater with a cross disciplinary approach. Researchers come from a

    SCRiM hosts Summer Scholars

    Students' research aims at issues surrounding climate change

    September 2016

    UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa -- Some think of summer as a quiet time on a college
    campus, but a diverse group of students spent their break hard at work on a
    common problem – climate change.

    Students and recent graduates from Penn State and universities across the
    country gathered this summer at the University Park campus as part of the
    2016 Summer Scholars Program, hosted by the Network for Sustainable Climate
    Risk Management (SCRiM).

    SCRiM Summer Scholar 2016

    The Summer Scholars program brings together students with diverse
    backgrounds – from environmental studies to statistics to philosophy – and
    pairs them with SCRiM researchers for nine weeks of full-time work on
    independent research projects.

    As their backgrounds would suggest, the 21 students explored climate change
    from a number of perspectives, including studying possible social impacts
    on the people threatened most by rising sea levels, and developing tools to
    help decision makers faced with complex issues.

    "When you think of climate change, you usually think of science and hard
    facts behind it," said Zabrenna Griffiths, an undergraduate at Florida
    Agricultural and Mechanical University who participated in the program. "I
    really like the approach SCRiM takes. It's interdisciplinary, so you have
    an ethical side, a statistical side and a science side."

    SCRiM, a National Science Foundation-supported research network centered at
    Penn State, seeks to find sustainable, scientifically sound,
    technologically feasible, economically efficient and ethically defensible
    climate risk management strategies.

    "I think climate change is a very interdisciplinary problem," said Rachana
    Ghimire, an undergraduate student at Washington and Lee University and
    summer scholar. "Since it's that type of problem, it requires that type of
    solution, and I think that's what makes SCRiM so unique."

    Ghimire worked this summer under the supervision of Martin Vezer, a
    postdoctoral scholar with SCRiM, analyzing flood maps and social
    vulnerability in a section of New Orleans. Ghimire said she gained valuable
    insight working with her mentor and alongside students from varying
    backgrounds.

    "In my program this year, we have geology majors, we have biology majors,
    we have ecology majors, we have economics majors and we have philosophy
    majors," she said. "We have all these people from all these disciplines
    being drawn to climate change and looking for different solutions."

    Nina Preston, another summer scholar, studied potential risk of sea level
    rise for people in low lying areas of Bangladesh. Before coming to Penn
    State, Preston didn't know much about how ice dynamics influence sea level
    rise globally. Moving forward, she said, it will be an important part of

    Pollard wins breakthrough of the year award.

    David Pollard, a senior scientist with the Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute, was honored Sunday for his pioneering work modeling glacial ice
    in Greenland and Antarctica.

    Pollard received the Paul F. Robertson Award for Breakthrough of the Year
    at the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences' annual Wilson Awards Banquet.

    Created in 2012 with support from a generous gift by EMS alumnus Paul F.
    Robertson, the award is given for breakthroughs in research or in the
    scholarship of teaching.

    "Dave deserves this award because he is the preeminent person in the world
    who understands how to model ice sheets and ice shelves," said Susan L.
    Brantley, distinguished professor of geosciences and director of EESI. "His
    model is really the best model in terms of quantitatively predicting what
    happens to an ice sheet and ice shelves in terms of change, evolution over
    time. And we are really interested in this, because as the climate changes
    the ice sheet is melting and how that impacts sea level will really impact
    humans around the planet."

    Pollard, who has worked at Penn State for 17 years, has developed a
    world-renowned model noted for its ability to run simulations over
    long-time frames quickly and without sacrificing accuracy. His recent work
    examines the grounding zone, the edges of an ice sheet where the ice
    becomes afloat on the ocean. The zone is a critical region that is
    projected to contribute to sea level rise as ice there melts, breaks and
    enters the ocean at an accelerating pace.

    "Dave has picked out a very interesting way of putting the real physics of
    unstable grounding zones in between really fast pieces of his model on
    either side, so it does a good job of getting the grounding zone right,
    without bogging down the model so it can't do the simulations you need,"
    said Richard Alley, Evan Pugh professor of geosciences and director of
    PSICE, who along with Brantley nominated Pollard for the award.

    Pollard's model suggests there is a potential for self-accelerating,
    runaway retreat as more and more grounded ice in the West Antarctic
    interior is lost to the ocean. Changes in the ice are already contributing
    to sea level rise, and are expected to accelerate in the future.

    "One of the primary reasons we study these big ice sheets is because of the
    potential effect on sea level," Pollard said. "There is so much water
    stored up in these big ice sheets that if substantial parts of them melt in
    the future, as they have in the past, that could change sea level."

    Richard Alley receives BBVA Foundation awardRichard Alley (photo)

    January 2015

    Please join us in congratulating Professor Richard Alley on being awarded
    the prestigious BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Climate
    change. In its citation, the jury praised Alley for his "pioneering
    research" into the "mechanics of ice and its implications for abrupt
    climate change."

    Jury member Miquel Canals refereed to Alley as "our best interpreter of
    ice. Although there are others working in different aspects of the field,
    he is the one who completed the circle: in ice he has read the history of
    the atmosphere, with its phases of abrupt change. He has elucidated its
    mechanisms of formation and deformation and how it interacts with climate.
    Alley explains the present while keeping a window open to the past and
    analyzing possible future paths."

    The BBVA Foundation awards seek to recognize and encourage world-class
    research and artistic creation, prizing contributions of lasting impact for
    their originality, theoretical significance and ability to push back the
    frontiers of the known world. Previous winners include Wally Broecker,
    Klaus Hasselmann, Nicholas Stern, Isaac Held, Susan Solomon, and
    Christopher Field.

    "Climate change doesn't just mean the globe is warming, it also means ice
    is melting," said Dr. Susan L. Brantley, who nominated Alley for the award.
    "Richard Alley is the premier ice specialist in the world and has done more
    than anyone to educate us about changing and moving polar ice. Richard and
    I have worked together for many years in Penn State's Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute and I am exceedingly proud of his
    accomplishments. This award is richly deserved."

    Composting expert Al Matyasovsky discusses Univeristy's efforts to cut
    waste

    November 2013

    Penn State is giving new life to thousands of tons of garbage that would
    typically get shipped to a landfill -- turning it into a gardener's dream
    ingredient -- compost.

    The program, formerly known as "No Can Do" and now named "Mobius" is being
    expanded to include composting bins in buildings all across campus. The
    university is asking faculty, staff and students to toss that banana peel,
    paper napkin and unfinished sandwich into building composting bins, not the
    garbage cans.

    "It's about doing the right thing with our waste and managing it," said Al
    Matyasovsky, supervisor of central support services in the Office of
    Physical Plant, during a recent talk he gave about composting to faculty
    and staff in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences' Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute.

    The composting program is now in about 70 buildings, including
    Earth-Engineering Science and Deike buildings. Matyaskovsky said about four
    to five buildings are being added each week, with an end goal of reaching
    all 742 buildings on campus in the next few years. It's part of the
    University-wide effort to dramatically reduce landfill waste, which
    includes other initiatives such as the annual Trash to Treasure sale. In
    that case, students who are moving out of on-campus housing donate their
    usable items that are then resold rather than being pitched in the garbage
    and sent to a landfill.

    In the case of composting, faculty, staff and students toss their organic
    garbage in the composting bin. Those bins are outfitted with compostable
    bags made from corn starch and cotton seed and collected frequently to head
    off problems with odor and insects. The composting rule, Matyasovsky said,
    is: "if it rots, pitch it in."

    From those bins, the compost is taken to the university's central
    composting site, where it's turned into black gold that's later used to
    fertilize the plants and trees around campus. Last year, Penn State
    produced 15,372 tons of garbage, but 9,853 tons or 65 percent of it was
    diverted from the landfills. That year, the university produced 1,300 tons
    of compost — a number that will grow as the program expands.

    "We're not going to be satisfied until nothing goes into a landfill,"
    Matyasovsky said. For more information on the program, go to Penn State

    Scientists who master the art of communication not only do a good job
    explaining their work and its importance, they become better scientists in
    the process.

    That was the message of Nancy Baron, a science communications expert who
    talked at Penn State in September as part of a workshop she held for
    faculty in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences' Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute and the Penn State Institutes of Energy and
    the Environment.

    "Going public forces you to distill facets of your work, and to think
    harder about the questions, the scientific questions, what's known and
    what's still left to discover," Baron said. "Being a communicator isn't an
    add-on. It makes you better at science."

    Baron is director of science outreach at COMPASS, which helps scientists
    communicate their work to journalists, policy makers and the public. She is
    author of "Escape from the Ivory Tower: A Guide to Making Your Science
    Matter," lead trainer for the Leopold Leadership Program and recipient of
    the 2013 Peter Benchley Ocean Award for Excellence in Media.

    Among the advice Baron shared with the students and faculty in the audience
    was to be transparent when presenting information; find effective metaphors
    for explaining complex subjects; and be yourself.

    The Penn State Institutes of Energy and the Environment and the Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute in the College of Earth and Mineral
    Sciences sponsored her visit to University Park. Along with the talk, "The
    Risks and Rewards of Science Communication," Baron's visit included a
    daylong workshop with EMS and PSIEE faculty focused on finding ways to
    effectively communicate their research subjects.

    have that clarity of expression — the ability to cut to the chase," she
    said. "So if each of you was to think of somebody who you really admire as
    a leader, chances are they are an effective communicator."

    2013 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    EESI project part of new NSF report focused on research taking place in the
    "critical zones"

    Report features Penn State EESI initiative looking at areas impacted by
    Marcellus Shale gas drilling

    July 2013

    A new report from the National Science Foundation offers a look at the work
    being done by researchers who are studying what is known as the Earth's
    critical zone, including the research a Penn State team is leading in the
    Susquehanna Shale Hills.

    "Discoveries in the Critical Zone: Where Life Meets Rock" by Cheryl Dybas,
    of the NSF, is available as a pdf on the Critical Zone Observatory website.

    In the introduction to the report, Wendy Harrison, director of the Division
    of Earth Sciences at the NSF, says that scientists involved in the projects
    are "seeking answers."

    "They're working to understand Earth's critical zone -- the region between
    the top of the tree canopy and the base of weathered rock -- and its
    response to climate and land use changes," Harrison says.

    The section of the report focused on the Susquehanna Shale Hills in
    Pennsylvania notes that the project being led by Sue Brantley,
    distinguished professor of geosciences at Penn State, has been expanded to
    include a Marcellus Shale Research Network, focused on collecting data
    about water quality in the region where natural gas drilling using deep
    horizontal drilling has taken off.

    "Successfully developing new energy resources while maintaining healthy
    ecosystems is the very heart of sustainability," Brantley says.

    For the full report, go to the Critical Zone Observatory or the NSF.

    EESI research featured on new YouTube and Facebook pages

    "Slices of Time" and other videos available online

    June 2013

    “Slices of Time,” a 13-minute video explaining how the earth’s surface can
    change in processes that happen in millionths of a second or over the
    course of millions of years, is available on Penn State’s Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute’s YouTube and Facebook pages.

    Using a stream affected by acid mine drainage to explain how changes occur
    in a landscape, the video shows what happens in that stream over time —
    from water molecules attacking the pyrite at speeds too fast to see with
    the naked eye to weathering breaking down rocks naturally over thousands of
    years.

    Another video on the EESI YouTube and Facebook pages features the
    interdisciplinary research being done through the Susquehanna Shale Hills
    Critical Zone Observatory project. The Penn State researchers explain the
    work they’re doing in the Huntingdon County Shale Hills as part of a larger
    National Science Foundation initiative aimed at understanding the earth’s
    critical zone.

##  News Archive 2013 - Study finds need for water quality data in the Marcellus Shale region 


     Marcellus Shale region

    2013 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    Review finds need for more water quality data in the Marcellus shale region

    May 2013

    What to do with Marcellus Shale wastewater is one of the biggest concerns
    in Pennsylvania, and few published studies have evaluated such wastewater
    effects on regional waters, according to a review coauthored by professors
    at the University of Pittsburgh and Penn State University.

    Published online today in the peer-reviewed journal Science, the review
    stresses the need for scientific data on water pollution caused by
    hydraulic fracturing and cites a lack of monitoring stations and
    requirements concerning confidentiality as potential causes. The review is
    titled "Impact of Shale Gas Development on Regional Water Quality."

    Susan L. Brantley, Distinguished Professor of Geosciences at Penn State and
    coauthor of the review, said the findings highlight the need for more
    thorough and consistent water quality monitoring and more information about
    risk factors associated with the different parts of the region where deep
    horizontal drilling is taking place.

    "Natural gas migration is a well-known natural phenomenon in many areas of
    Pennsylvania even before gas well drilling. When gas wells are drilled,
    sometimes the gas migrates around the well and into the groundwater. Though
    this is not common, more information is needed about the site-specific risk
    factors that contribute to those problems," Brantley said. "Geological
    conditions can vary from one gas drilling site to another, and without that
    information it will be difficult to definitively answer the question of
    whether gas extraction through hydraulic fracturing is having an impact of
    water resources."

    Intensive extraction of gas inside of the Marcellus shale began in the
    eastern United States in 2005 and the Marcellus has quickly become one of
    the top five unconventional gas reservoirs in the country. Previous studies
    have estimated this area could yield 489 trillion cubic feet of natural
    gas—an amount requiring high volumes of water used for what is often
    referred to as "slickwater fracturing."

    Major concerns for the public have been whether stray methane can
    contaminate water supplies and whether the chemicals in the fluid used
    during the hydraulic fracturing process pose a threat to drinking water
    aquifers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is currently studying
    the risks to groundwater from hydraulic fracturing.

    "While stray gas can be minor and easily remedied, there has been one case
    attributed to a Marcellus shale well in which stray gas accumulation in a
    private water well was associated with an explosion that blew a concrete
    lid off the well," said Brantley, director of the Earth and Environmental
    Systems Institute at Penn State.

    The main cause of stray gas in private water wells is not having an
    adequate cement seal around the well and to a sufficient depth, which can
    allow the natural gas to migrate up into the groundwater.

    "However, there is no evidence for widespread increase in methane
    concentration in Pennsylvania groundwater. Instead, levels are similar to
    those recorded in New York, which has a moratorium on large-volume

    honored

    May 2013

    Sue Brantley, EESI director and a distinguished professor of geosciences,
    and Richard Alley, Evan Pugh professor of geosciences, will each receive an
    honorary degree from a university in recognition of their contributions to
    their field.

    The University of Wisconsin-Madison will honor Alley May 17 as part of the
    school's commencement ceremonies. Alley is recognized internationally as a
    leader in his field and has been honored for his work in the field of
    climate change. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2008
    and, as a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, was part
    of the group that received the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.

    Department of Geoscience Chair Brad Singer noted that Alley has made
    exceptional efforts to bring his research to his students, the public and
    policymakers.

    "He has dedicated himself to explaining this science, and its implications
    for society, to a broad audience," Singer said in a release from the
    University of Wisconsin.

    Alley earned a doctorate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1987.

    Brantley will receive an honorary doctorate from the University of
    Lausanne, Switzerland, May 31.

    Brantley is recognized for her pioneering work applying chemical and
    physical principles to geological processes at the earth's surface,
    including weathering and erosion. Her recent work includes studying the
    Critical Zone, the surface of the planet that sustains life.

    Brantley was elected to the National Academy of the Sciences and the
    Geological Society of America in 2012.

    2012 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    EESI announces a new High Performance Computing resource

    October 2012

    EESI would like to announce a new High Performance Computing resource that
    is available:

    Research Computing and Cyberinfrastructure (RCC) has just brought their
    newest HPC cluster, Lion XG, on line. Each computing server blade includes
    two Intel Xeon E5-2665 2.4 GHz 8-core processors (Sandybridge series), with
    64 or 128 gigabytes of 1600 MHz memory (4 or 8 gigabytes per core), 2.5" 1
    terabyte 7200 rpm NL-SAS drive, 56 gigabits/second FDR Infiniband
    interconnect (Mellanox Connect-X3 HCA and switches), and a separate 10
    gigabits/second Ethernet network and also a 10 Gbps uplink. This hardware
    is likely to have a formal life span of three years but RCC typically runs
    a cluster several years beyond that period.

    David Pollard received NSF funds to contribute to this for his research,
    and EESI partnered to secure priority access to 15 nodes on Lion-XG for
    EESI associates. As an EESI associate, if you would like to use this new
    cluster please contact John Miley at jmiley@eesi.psu.edu to arrange access.

    One important thing to note about Lion-XG is that it is running RedHat
    Enterprise Linux 6 as its operating system whereas the older Lion-X systems
    are all running RedHat Enterprise Linux 5. Because of this some codes that
    were compiled on the older systems will not run on Lion-XG without
    recompilation. In particular, if you are running anything on the older
    systems that was compiled with RCC's OpenMPI implementation, you will need
    to recompile due to ABI incompatibilities with the new OpenMPI version.
    Eventually all RCC cluster will be upgraded to RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.

    To see how Lion-XG compares to previous RCC clusters: http://
    rcc.its.psu.edu/resources/hpc/ (Lion-XG was decommissioned in December
    2017; link expired)

    For more specific details on Lion-XG please see: http://rcc.its.psu.edu/
    resources/hpc/lionxg/ (Lion-XG was decommissioned in December 2017; link
    expired)

    For information on using and accessing Lion-XG please see the RCC lion-x
    user guide: http://rcc.its.psu.edu/user_guides/systems/lionx/ (Lion-XG was
    decommissioned in December 2017; link expired)

     

    Please also note that whenever you write a proposal to get more such HPC
    equipment, EESI often can partner with you to provide more priority access
    to others in EESI.

    EESI Director Sue Brantley among those honored

    March 2013

    Three faculty members and a staff member in the College of Earth and
    Mineral Sciences were among those singled out this year for recognition by
    the University for excellence in education and research.

    Susan L. Brantley, distinguished professor of geosciences and director of
    the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute, received the Faculty Scholar
    Medal for work in the physical sciences. Peter Wilf, associate professor of
    geosciences, received a George W. Atherton Award for Excellence in
    Teaching. Robert Crane, professor of geography and director of the Alliance
    for Education, Science, Engineering and Development in Africa, received the
    W. LaMarr Kopp International Achievement Award for advancing the
    university's international mission. Martha Traverse, administrative
    assistant, received the Staff Excellence Award.

    President Rodney Erickson presented the 2013 awards at a recent recognition
    event. The honors are given to faculty and staff each year in honor of
    outstanding contributions. The four EMS employees were among those singled
    out for their excellence in teaching, research and service.

    "Penn State's strengths in the engineering and physical sciences are its
    imprimatur. Sue, Peter, Rob and Martha are the latest members of the
    College of Earth and Mineral Sciences to prove that they are a cut above,"
    said William Easterling, dean of the College.

    Brantley received the 2013 award for physical sciences in recognition of
    her pioneering work in applying chemical and physical principles to
    geological processes at the earth's surface, including weathering and
    erosion.

    Brantley said she was honored and surprised to get the Faculty Scholar
    medal at a college and university with so many talented scientists.

    "The best part of getting the medal was listening to the stories of all the
    other awardees, and being part of the terrific creativity we have here at
    Penn State," she said.

    Brantley has been a faculty member at Penn State since 1986. Her recent
    work includes research focused on the "critical zone," the planet's surface
    that sustains human life. One nominator said that the quantitative reactive
    transport models she developed represent a breakthrough for modeling
    weathering in the critical zone on the geological time scale and that the
    results have "broad implications" for understanding the role that
    weathering plays in soil formation, the fate of contaminants and the
    sequestration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide.

    Brantley is also a founder of the Shale Network, a collaborative effort by
    researchers from Penn State and other institutions to collect data on water
    quality in the shale gas drilling regions.

    In addition to her research and teaching, Brantley is director of the Earth

    ShaleNetwork Workshop Held April 22-23 in State College, PA

    April 2012

    Forty-one participants attended the ShaleNetwork Workshops at the Atherton
    Hotel, State College, PA on April 22-23, 2012. The workshop was presented
    by researchers from Penn State University, the University of Pittsburgh,
    Dickinson College, and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement
    of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc. (CUAHSI). With funds from the National Science
    Foundation (NSF), these researchers have been working since October 2011 to
    create the ShaleNetwork database as an online database. The ShaleNetwork
    team is also testing whether the inclusion of data from groups of citizen
    scientists can promote discovery and public education. The database
    currently contains data from community watershed groups, academic
    scientists, government agencies, and industry and includes analyses of 60
    different constituents for some samples.

    Of the 41 workshop attendees, 23 derived from universities, 6 from
    government agencies, 2 from environmental consulting firms, 3 from county
    district offices, and 7 from non-profit organizations. The participants
    were introduced to the ShaleNetwork database through HydroDesktop (
    www.hydrodesktop.org) a publicly available web service maintained by
    CUAHSI. By placing the ShaleNetwork database online at a CUAHSI
    Hydroserver, the data can be accessed along with data from the United
    States Geologic Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other

    Changing the Moral Climate on Climate Change

    April 2012

    April 30th at 7 pm in room 101 Thomas Building at Penn State’s University
    Park, a group of esteemed Penn State faculty and one graduate student/
    lecturer will confront the climate change denial machine. Over the last few
    years, we have been discouraged by the successful of "the merchants of
    doubt," a well-organized and well-funded climate change disinformation
    campaign. The five presenters of “Changing the Moral Climate on Climate
    Change” believe that as people working at a top-flight research and
    teaching institution, they have a responsibility to both inform the public
    about the many aspects of climate change – from social to environmental –
    and call for better action from universities in democratic society.

    Presentations come from Dr. (Juris) Donald Brown from Science, Technology,
    and Society and former Clinton administration UN representative and blogger
    at Climate Ethics, Peter Buckland, A.B.D. in Educational Theory and Policy
    and co-host of Sustainability Now Radio, Dr. Janet Swim from Psychology and
    chair of the 2009 American Psychological Associations task force on the
    psychology of climate change, Dr. Rick Schuhmann, an environmental engineer
    and Director of Penn State’s Engineering Leadership program, and Dr.
    Michael Mann, director of Penn State’s Earth System Science Center, member
    of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
    Change, and author of The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars.

    New Faculty Member Publishes in NatureJennifer Balch (photo)

    Jennifer K. Balch, who will join the faculty in Penn State’s Department of
    Geography in August 2012 as an assistant professor and EESI associate,
    co-authored a recent publication in Nature, entitled "The Amazon basin in
    transition." Jennifer is currently a postdoctoral associate at UC Santa
    Barbara’s National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis(NCEAS). Her
    research looks at the patterns and processes that underlie fire disturbance
    and ecosystem recovery, particularly in tropical forests.

    The recent Nature article reveals that human activity has begun to alter
    the regional water and energy cycles of the Amazon basin. The danger is
    that the Amazon may be shifting from a carbon sink to a carbon source. A
    strong sign of a new disturbance regime is the high number of recent
    large-scale wildfires, which are a byproduct of intentional fires in
    Brazil’s ‘arc of deforestation.’ In addition, it shows that ongoing
    interactions of deforestation, fire, and climate change have the potential
    to alter carbon storage, rainfall patterns and river discharge on an even
    larger basinwide scale. These wildfires are extremely frequent, occurring
    every few years, compared with every couple centuries in the past. To view
    the UCSB-NCEAS press-release go to: http://www.ia.ucsb.edu/pa/display.aspx?

    Richard Alley Receives the Stephens Schneider Award for Climate
    Communication

    December 2011

    December 6, 2011, Climate One at the Commonwealth Club presented Dr.
    Richard Alley, esteemed geologist and professor at Pennsylvania State
    University, the first Stephen Schneider Award for Climate Communication.
    The event was held in San Francisco, California near where the 2011
    American Geophysical Union Conference took place.

    Dr. Richard Alley is known for his clever presentation of key climate
    change issues to the public. He has testified before Congress using his
    bald head to illustrate ice age cycles, recorded a video on geoscience
    while playing Johnny Cash, and hosted the PBS documentary “Earth: The
    Operators Manual.” At the event, Dr. Alley offers fresh insights in climate
    science, communication, and the politicization of scientific inquiry.
    Several distinguished scientists and friends of the late Stanford
    climatologist, Stephen Schneider, were in the audience and Dr. Alley and
    two other scholars closed the program with a tune.

    Climate One programs are broadcast on public radio and local access
    television. Their live audience has the opportunity to be face to face with
    leaders in energy efficiency and environmental policies.

    More information about Climate One and upcoming programs can be found on
    their website, and tickets can be purchased for upcoming programs here.

    Ken Davis Measures Greenhouse Gas Emissions for World Economic Forum

    January 2012

    Ken Davis’s research group is measuring greenhouse gas emissions from the
    World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The meeting started on 25
    January and runs through Sunday, 29 January. Picarro, Inc., an instrument
    company that makes greenhouse gas sensors, was selected to be a technology
    innovation demonstration company at the WEF, and recruited Davis's research
    group as partners in the demonstration. Davis's group is a leader in
    developing the techniques needed to measure regional greenhouse gas fluxes
    using atmospheric budgets, and has a long history of working with Picarro
    instruments in their field experiments. The demonstration is monitoring CO2
    emissions from the mountain village of Davos in near real time as the WEF
    takes place. In addition to the Picarro greenhouse gas sensors, the
    experiment relies heavily upon meteorological simulations using the Weather
    Research and Forecast realtime forecasting system with chemistry, a
    community model modified for experiments such as this by scientists in the
    Department of Meteorology. The investigators hope to detect changes in
    emissions that occur as a result of the WEF, showing the utility of the
    method for monitoring "urban metabolism." These methods could be used by
    cities to evaluate the efficacy of efforts to reduce urban greenhouse gas
    emissions. Picarro hopes that the demonstration will serve as a call to
    city leaders to adopt active monitoring of urban greenhouse gas emissions.
    Results of the study will be released this Friday, 27 January.

    More information, including observations and models of CO2 concentrations
    and fluxes around Davos created by Picarro and Penn State scientists, can
    be seen at http://citycarbon.picarro.com.

    This project is supported in part by the Penn State Institutes of Energy
    and the Environment (PSIEE) and the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences.
    Davis is Professor of Meteorology in the Department of Meteorology, and is
    a faculty associate of the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute, both
    part of the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. Other Penn State
    researcher contributing to the project include Aijun Deng, Thomas Lauvaux,
    Natasha Miles and Scott Richardson, all members of the Department of
    Meteorology.

##  News Archive 2011 - 'Toward a Marcellus Flowback Water "Signature”, and Perspectives on Environmental Impacts' 


     Environmental Impacts'

    November 2011

    Carl Kirby, Bucknell University, Department of Geology

    The most likely sources of surface and groundwater contamination from
    hydraulic fracturing for natural gas extraction from the Marcellus and
    other shales are disturbance of coalbed methane, well casing failure, and
    surface leaks and spills. Currently there is no reliable chemical
    “signature” or “fingerprint” that can delineate Marcellus flowback waters
    from other sources with high conductivity such as mine drainage or road
    salt. A combination of selected geochemical parameters including Cl, Br,
    SO4, and stable isotopes appears that it will provide unique identifiers
    for Marcellus flowback waters.

    Q: Is gas extraction and production in the Marcellus safe?

    A: Is driving a car safe?

    The above is the wrong question. What we need to know is the risks of
    environment impacts due to shale gas extraction. Much of the data we need
    to understand the risks is lacking. The risks need to be analyzed and then
    compared to past and especially environmental impacts of extractive
    industries and other development.

     

    Dr. Kirby's talk will take place in 112 Walker Building at 4:00 p.m. on
    November 14

    2011 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    Brantley honored with Arthur L. Day Medal

    October 2011

    Susan L. Brantley, director of the Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute, is the recipient of the 2011 Arthur L. Day Medal from the
    Geological Society of America (GSA).

    GSA announced Brantley's award in its July 2011 issue of GSA Today.

    Brantley, Distinguished Professor of Geosciences, is a leading scientist in
    the study of the complex chemical and geological processes that shape and
    transform the Critical Zone, the part of the Earth where rock meets life
    extending from groundwater to the top of vegetation. She has been credited
    with making breakthrough contributions in understanding weathering
    processes and their interaction with the atmosphere and biological systems
    and with being a pioneer in the application of iron isotopes to soil
    processes.

    "Her uncommon vision has broken ground in geochemical research by
    identifying new and significant research avenues for her colleagues in her
    own generation and the next," wrote one nominee of Brantley's
    contributions.

    Another nominee described Brantley as "the outstanding aqueous geochemist
    of her generation."

    Her research investigating geochemical processes in natural systems has
    been supported by the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of
    Energy and NASA. She is a co-PI of the 20-acre Susquehanna Shale Hills
    Observatory, located near the University's Stone Valley Recreation Center
    and part of the NSF-supported Critical Zone Observatory network.

    In the 63-year history of the award, Brantley is the first Penn State
    faculty member to receive the Arthur L. Day Medal while working at the
    University. The 1967 prize went to O. Frank Tuttle, who joined Penn State
    in 1953 and served as dean of the College of Mineral Industries from
    1959-60 but who was at Stanford University when he received the medal.

##  News Archive 2011 - Richard Alley receives prestigious Heinz Award 


 
    2011 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    Richard Alley receives prestigious Heinz AwardDavid Pollard (photo)

    September 2015

    Penn State University Professor, Dr. Richard Alley, discovered massive
    climate shifts can happen abruptly

    PITTSBURGH, September 13, 2011 − Teresa Heinz and the Heinz Family
    Foundation today announced Richard Alley, Ph. D., a professor at The
    Pennsylvania State University and leader in climate and polar ice studies,
    as a recipient of a $100,000 Heinz Award. Dr. Alley has been a professor at
    The Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pa. since 1988.

    Dr. Alley's research broke open the field of "abrupt climate change," with
    his discovery that the last Ice Age came to an abrupt end over a period of
    only three years. This has significant implications for the present day as
    it debunked the myth that climate change is a very slow process, and
    suggests that some climate changes in response to human-induced activities,
    particularly the burning of fossil fuels, may arrive more rapidly than
    expected. Dr. Alley and others had removed two-mile long polar ice core
    samples in Greenland and in Antarctica to study climate history and
    elements that lead to climatic changes.

    "Dr. Alley"s research on ice cores has provided an essential cornerstone to
    the study of environmental change," Teresa Heinz, chairman of the Heinz
    Family Foundation, said today. "He discovered that such changes can be
    abrupt and massive and he is able to communicate these complex ideas in a
    clear and compelling way."

    Dr. Alley is considered one of the most active voices in communicating
    earth sciences to the general public. Earlier this year, he hosted a PBS
    special on climate change and sustainable energy called Earth: The
    Operators' Manual. He authored a companion book by the same name that was
    targeted to everyday Americans. From low-tech solutions to high-tech
    innovations, the documentary shows the wide range of practical options
    available to meet Earth's growing need for energy.

    "Climate change is an enormous challenge that requires big action. Our
    grandchildren will one day ask us to explain the choices our leaders made
    today," said Dr. Alley.

    Now in their 17th year, the Heinz Awards honor visionaries who have made
    extraordinary contributions to the environment, a life-long area of
    commitment for the late U.S. Senator John Heinz. Dr. Alley and nine others
    are recognized for their significant efforts benefitting the environment.
    This year's awards total $900,000.

    Dr. Alley is active in the scientific community, having presided over the

    Seamus McGraw - Marcellus Shale Author

    September 2011

    Marcellus Author: "It's About Making Hard Choices in a Hard Land in Hard
    Times"

    Journalist and Pennsylvania native Seamus McGraw will share portraits of
    northeastern Pennsylvania landowners who suddenly discover their farms sit
    atop a natural gas bonanza and their struggles to make the right family,
    environmental and moral decisions about leasing their land Thursday, Sept.
    15 in the Foster Auditorium, 102 Paterno Library.

    In The End of Country published in June 2011, McGraw draws on his personal
    knowledge of the region and its residents to weave together a portrait of
    the land and the people against the backdrop of Marcellus Shale
    development.

    Some environmentalists have decried what they see as the book's endorsement
    of a fossil fuel while some in the industry have bristled at its candid
    portrayal of the risks of natural gas drilling, dubbing it "'Gasland' on
    paper," McGraw says.

    "My book is not about dogmatic, partisan, ideological points of view but
    about very real people trying to do the right thing in a very complicated
    situation," McGraw says. "I want people to see and identify with the
    reality that transcends the dogma."

    Open to the public, McGraw's reading and talk will begin at noon. A book
    signing will follow at 1 p.m. This event is sponsored by the Penn State
    Marcellus Center for Outreach and Research (marcellus.psu.edu) and the Penn
    State University Libraries. For more information, contact the Marcellus
    Center, (814) 865-1587 or marcellus@psu.edu.

    2011 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    2011 Center Funding Support Announced

    August 2011

    Seven interdisciplinary research initiatives will receive funding support
    from EESI for three consecutive years, beginning in 2011-12. These centers
    are committed to collaborative and forward-looking research on the
    unprecedented environmental challenges facing the earth system.

    Included in the seven is the new initiative for Energy and Environmental
    Economics and Policy to be directed by Seth Blumsack that will unify
    current collaborations to create a robust University-wide and
    interdisciplinary research community in energy economics and policy.

    Several existing centers also will receive funding and, in some cases,
    staff support:

      □ Center for Environmental geoChemistry and Genomics (CECG) led by Jenn
        Macalady;
      □ Center for Environmental Informatics (CEI) led by Doug Miller;
      □ Center for Climate Risk Management (CLIMA) led by Klaus Keller;
      □ Earth System Science Center (ESSC) led by Michael Mann;
      □ Penn State Ice and Climate Exploration Center (PSICE) led by Sridhar
        Anandakrishnan;
      □ Riparia led by Rob Brooks

    The funding awards were decided as a result of the EESI Center Competition
    held in May which included proposal presentations by center directors who
    detailed their initiatives, goals and objectives.

    In addition to these centers, one EESI-affiliated research center not
    seeking funds also made a presentation at the competition. The Marcellus
    Center for Outreach and Research, led by Mike Arthur and Tom Murphy,
    benefits from space and staff support associated with EESI.

##  News Archive 2011 - New EESI-Supported Initiative in Energy and Environmental Economics and Policy 


     Environmental Economics and Policy

    2011 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    New EESI-Supported Initiative in Energy and Environmental Economics and
    Policy

    July 2011

    EEEP - established in Summer 2011

    EESI is one of several research units on campus supporting a new
    cross-College Initiative focused on the study of economic and policy
    challenges related to energy production and utilization; the management of
    environmental resources; and the environmental impacts of energy systems.
    The Energy and Environmental Economics and Policy Initiative (EEEP) was
    established during the summer of 2011, following the annual EESI Center
    Competition. The Initiative also receives support from PSIEE and the
    Environment and Natural Resources Institute, housed in the College of
    Agriculture. Seth Blumsack, from the Leone Family Department of Energy and
    Mineral Engineering; and Karen Fisher-Vanden, from Agricultural Economics
    and Rural Sociology, are the Initiative's co-Directors. Both are trained
    economists but work on research problems that cut across disciplinary
    boundaries.

    The Initiative's goals are to create a network of policy economists across
    Penn State whose activities focus on energy and environmental systems; and
    to foster interdisciplinary research at the boundary of economics, policy
    and the study of environmental or engineered systems. "Our Initiative
    recognizes that society’s energy and environmental challenges are more
    intertwined than ever before," said Blumsack. "Penn State has long had
    strengths in both energy and environmental economics across the University,
    which is a unique and powerful combination. Through EEEP we are hoping to
    coalesce these strengths into a more recognized network."

    The Initiative's activities include running a regular seminar series
    featuring distinguished speakers from inside and outside the University,
    and offering support to participating faculty and graduate students working
    on energy or environmental economics research. The seminar series began in
    the fall of 2011 and will continue into the spring. The seminars have
    featured speakers from Resources for the Future and Carnegie-Mellon
    University, along with Penn State energy and environmental economists.
    Blumsack and Fisher-Vanden are also in the process of seeking approval to
    transform the Initiative into a University-recognized Center. Once Center
    status has been attained, a public web site will be established featuring
    information about the Center’s activities and offering a public portal to
    energy and environmental economics at Penn State.

    Examples of current research projects involving faculty associated with the
    Initiative include:

      □ Co-Director Karen Fisher-Vanden is a lead author for the IPCC fifth
        assessment report, in the Climate Change Mitigation working group.
      □ R.J. Briggs has been investigating the role of deregulation and
        institutional change in the electric power sector on air emissions from
        generating plants.
      □ Co-director Seth Blumsack has published two recent papers examining the
        impacts of wind energy development on environmental quality.  One
        paper, published in Energy Policy discusses how wind-turbine siting
        decisions affect emissions from electric power systems (see figure);
        the other, forthcoming in Journal of Regulatory Economics, demonstrates

    April 2011

    Speaker to address managing predicted water-resources stresses and
    water-related hazards

    Matthew Larsen, U.S. Geological Survey, will discuss the critical
    challenges facing national governments attempting to mitigate current and
    predicted water-resources challenges and water-related hazards as part of
    the spring EarthTalks series, "Where Climate Science Meets the Road:
    Managing Resources for Climate Change."

    His talk, "Global Change and Water Resources Management Challenges in the
    Next 100 Years," is scheduled for 4 p.m., Monday, April 25, in 112 Walker.

    "The U.S. and other regions of the world are engaged in national-scale,
    multi-year population, land use and economic experiments which pose major
    water-resources challenges and potential conflicts for the 21st century,"
    said Larsen, associate director with Climate and Land Use Change (USGS).

    "Those include expansion of and shift to irrigated agriculture, degradation
    of riparian and estuarine ecosystems, and population increases in
    water-scarce regions. In addition, climate change models predict
    precipitation and streamflow patterns will change in coming decades,"
    Larsen said.

    "The challenges that we face this century include a combination of local
    and national management problems that are already upon us, as well as
    emerging and future problems that are closely associated with rising
    temperature and changes in the distribution of precipitation," Larsen said.

    Before being named associate director for Climate and Land Use Change in
    2010, Larsen served as USGS's associate director for water. He also has
    served as the chief scientist for hydrology and led the USGS National
    Research Program in hydrology.

    April 2011

    Speaker to address challenges in Climate Change Assessment and Information
    Transfer

    Dan Vimont, assistant professor in the University of Wisconsin's
    Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Department, will discuss how the Wisconsin
    Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI) is both assessing climate
    change impacts on Wisconsin’s natural and built resources and developing
    adaptation strategies for a wide variety of stakeholders.

    His talk, "The Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts: Adapting to
    Climate Change in Wisconsin," is scheduled for 4 p.m., Monday, April 4, in
    112 Walker.

    "One of the challenges of assessing and adapting to climate change involves
    linking information between physical, biological, and social systems,"
    Vimont said. "This information sharing is essential across multiple scales
    of activity and through multiple channels."

    WICCI is engaged in that communication, and Vimont will share the
    organization’s activities with an emphasis on illustrating how WICCI's
    organizational structure facilitates communication between different
    groups.

    Vimont, who serves on the WICCI Science Council, also will present a set of
    downscaled climate data for Wisconsin, including a description of how the
    downscaling technique addresses needs of multiple assessment activities.

    Speaker to examine links between Green Building and Climate Change
    Adaptation

    Chris Pyke, vice president of research for the U.S. Green Building Council,
    will discuss how green building can advance resilience and adaptation to
    climate change as part of the spring EarthTalks series, "Where Climate
    Science Meets the Road: Managing Resources for Climate Change."

    His talk, "Green Building and Climate Change: Developing Practical
    Strategies for Adaptation and Resilience in Built Environments," is
    scheduled for 4 p.m., Monday, March 28, in 112 Walker.

    Green building offers a vision for built environments that are better for
    people and the environment and has become a core part of the real estate
    industry around the world, Pyke says. Today, green building professionals
    understand the role of the built environment in mitigating greenhouse gas
    emissions. But connections to resilience and adaptation have yet to be
    made, and practical, science-based strategies and tools are not widely
    available.

    Pyke also serves as the vice chair of the Chesapeake Bay Program's

     Decisions

    2011 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    Keller uses Earth System Analysis to improve Climate DecisionsKlaus Keller
    (photo)

    January 2011

    Imagine you have to decide whether and how much to raise a levee to protect
    a coastal community from the projected rise in sea levels associated with
    climate change.

    You know that sea levels have risen during the last century and are
    projected to continue to rise-leading to an increased risk of flooding
    absent of adaptations. You also know that raising the levee will reduce the
    flooding risk.

    The question is how much would you raise the levee?

    One option is to heighten the levee by a small amount, hoping that the
    future sea level rise will be at the low end of the projections. A more
    expensive but arguably safer option is to build a higher levee that can
    handle the high-end of the sea-level projections.

    "A workable risk management strategy has to be scientifically sound,
    economically efficient, and ethically defensible—which requires an
    interdisciplinary approach," says Klaus Keller, director of the Center for
    Climate Risk Management (CLIMA) and associate professor of geosciences.
    "Analyzing those strategies requires that natural and social scientists and
    ethicists collaborate effectively—a non-trivial challenge.

    "However, this is a stimulating challenge because the collaborations
    between decision makers, stakeholders and natural and social scientists can
    lead to exciting, mission-oriented basic research," Keller says.

    CLIMA helps this research by catalyzing the interdisciplinary interactions
    that improve the analysis and design of climate risk management strategies.

    To return to the example of how high to raise the levee, the design of
    flood risk management strategies is often driven by low-probability,
    high-impact events such as one-in-100- or one-in-10,000-year flooding.
    Characterizing those low-probability, high-impact events requires
    mechanistically sound models that are carefully tested and calibrated with
    instrumental and paleo observations.

    Keller acknowledges that all models are imperfect, but argues that some can
    still be useful to improve decisions.

    "The basic choice is often: Do we wait for better data and models and in
    the meantime neglect low-probability, high-impact events or do we analyze
    them with imperfect but still useful models?" Keller says. "Neglecting
    low-probability, high-impact events can lead to downward biases in risk
    estimates."

    While climate science is a well-established and active science,
    considerable uncertainties—such as about future sea levels—still remain.
    But uncertainty does not have to result in paralysis.

    We make many decisions under deep uncertainty: which career path to pick,
    whether to marry or whether to purchase life insurance. Hedging against a

    That's among the conclusions that Rob Brooks, professor of geography and
    ecology, has reached after 15 years of assessment and restoration research
    in collaboration with faculty, staff, and students of the Penn State
    Cooperative Wetlands Center. Brooks will share those findings on Monday,
    Oct. 20,as part of this year’s EarthTalks colloquium series, "Quenching the
    Thirst."

    His talk, scheduled for 4 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 20, in 112 Walker Building,
    is free and open to the public.

    "Our research has documented the degradation in flora, faunal communities
    and physical attributes, as well as the reduction in wetland functions,
    that has been caused by human activities," says Brooks, who is the Director
    of the Cooperative Wetlands Center. "Fortunately, our data from natural
    reference wetlands can be used to design restored and mitigated wetlands
    and to assess their performance."

    As part of his talk, "Understanding Wetlands, the Other Water: Origins,
    Assessment and Restoration," Brooks will discuss freshwater wetlands, where
    they are found, how they are formed and what ecosystems services they
    provide. He also will examine how wetlands’ interact with streams, rivers,
    lakes and estuaries in a watershed context.

    "Quenching the Thirst" is sponsored by the Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute, the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, the College of
    Agricultural Sciences and the Penn State Institutes of Energy and the
    Environment.

    Budget justification proposal text

    July 2008

    Text for budget justification sections of proposals

    The following text segments are for use by proposers in their Budget
    Justification sections, regarding the contribution to EESI scientific
    computing support discussed above. Note that this is the exact text that
    proposers must use.

    Federal funding, EESI associate:
    The bulk of computing will be performed on the high-performance Linux
    cluster Lion-XO, partially owned by EESI and maintained by the High
    Performance Computing Group (HPC) at Penn State University. EESI provides
    access at the highest priority level for job scheduling on the Lion-XO to
    any EESI associate on a funded basis. EESI computer support personnel will
    work with , providing necessary scientific computational research support
    for the proposed work. To work with the Lion-XO, each EESI associate must
    provide approximately $5000 of salary support per year for the EESI support
    personnel.

    Federal funding, CEKA associate: (see note below).
    The bulk of computing will be performed on the high-performance Linux
    cluster Lion-XO, partially owned by CEKA and maintained by the High
    Performance Computing Group (HPC) at Penn State University. CEKA provides
    access at the highest priority level for job scheduling on the Lion-XO to

    2008 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    Proposed 2008-09 Research Centers

    November 2008

    New research centers proposed for EESI

    Proposals for several new centers committed to interdisciplinary research
    and educational activities in environmental sciences were recently aired at
    the EESI Center Proposal Presentations (May 7) as directors of those
    centers detailed their initiatives, noting goals and objectives.

    EESI supports faculty-directed centers with operating funds and staff and
    by providing physical space. Currently, 10 centers are part of EESI.

    Directors of six of EESI's existing centers also outlined their work. Those
    centers include the Center for Energy and Environmental Risk, CEER, Center
    for environmental Kinetics Analysis, CEKA, Center for Environmental
    Informatics, CEI, Earth System Science Center, ESSC, Penn State Ice and
    Climate Research Center, PSICE, and the Center for Public Policy Research
    on the Environment, Energy and Community. EESI also is home to the
    Northeastern Regional Center of the DOE National Institute for Climate
    Change Research located at Penn State.

    The proposed new centers include: Center for Climate Risk Management, CRIM,
    which would be directed by Klaus Keller and which would build
    interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty in engineering, economics,
    earth sciences and statistics. Klaus indicated climate risk management is a
    fast-growing field, and a center with that focus was a natural extension of
    Penn State's expertise in climate risk assessment.

    Center for Land-Air-Water Studies, CLAWS, which will bring together climate
    and soil scientists, chemical and biological oceanographers,
    hydrogeologists and glaciologists to study the critical interfaces of
    global climate change. The center's activities and foci will include
    process studies and fieldwork Anne Thompson would serve as director.

    Riparia which would draw upon and expand the work of the Cooperative
    Wetlands Center. Its focus would include wetlands ecology, landscape
    hydrology and watershed management. Rob Brooks would serve as director.

    The centers which will receive EESI support for 2008-09 will be announced
    in early June.

##  News Archive 2007 - CEKA/EESI high performance computing resource 


 
    2007 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    CEKA/EESI high performance computing resource

    July 2007

    The Center for Environmental Kinetics Analysis (CEKA) within the Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute (EESI) has had its high performance Lion-XO
    cluster online for approximately 18 months now. It continues to be a highly
    successful venture, with 35 active users and full utilization of its
    capacity.This cluster is maintained and operated by the High Performance
    Computing Group (HPC/GEaRS/ASET/ITS) at Penn State University, and CEKA/
    EESI owns 32 quad-processor nodes on this cluster. Although primarily
    intended for CEKA research, this cluster is available for use by any EESI
    associate, with the following proviso. In order to participate, the EESI
    associate must provide a contribution of $5000 per year in salary for EESI
    support personnel (J. Miley, D. Pollard and a computational chemistry
    support person), to provide scientific computational support for EESI users
    of the cluster.

    This scientific support will involve general advice on software, Fortran,
    numerical methods, and help with a limited set of particular models (for
    chemistry: GAUSSIAN, VASP; for climate: GENESIS, MOM2, RegCM3, in-house
    ice-sheet and vegetation models).The standard HPC/GEaRS method of
    computer-time priority and allocation applies to all participating EESI
    users, as follows.

    Each group is assigned a fair-share target equal to the percentage of the
    cluster that they own. For CEKA/EESI, this is currently 44.4% (owning 32*4
    = 128 out of a total 288 CPUs in Lion-XO). Group usage is tracked by HPC
    over a sliding window that is typically 6 weeks.

    As long as the group's usage as a whole is less than their target, their
    jobs continue to run at highest priority. If at any time the group's
    sliding-window usage rises above their target, their jobs will run at low
    priority (treated as non-partner users) until their usage drops below the
    target again. Besides the group-based fair-share above, there is a
    user-based fair share between members of the same group. This is weighted
    many orders of magnitude lower than the group-based fair-share, so that it
    is negligible between groups but still works within them. Although the
    CEKA-group fair-share allocation is shared between all EESI users, it is
    anticipated that over-use will not occur, especially in the next few years,
    and substantial fractions of it will be available to individual heavy
    users. Note that participation with a $5000 EESI-support contribution
    provides much more high-priority CPU-time than an individual purchase of
    one or two nodes on a GEaRS cluster: for instance, the purchase of one
    4-quad node would cost ~$5000 or more, but would only provide fair-share
    usage of 1.4% of Lion-XO, compared to a substantial fraction of CEKA/EESI's
    44.4%.The recently reconstituted Earth System Science Center headed by
    Michael Mann has purchased a similar HPC resource that has been subsidized
    by EESI. This cluster will be managed very similarly to Lion-X0. This
    system has just come online and preliminary testing is about to be
    finished. The system is named Lion-XC and is an Intel based cluster
    currently comprised of 96 nodes. Each node has two dual core 3.0 GHz
    Woodcrest CPU's. By mid-summer this cluster will be fully populated with
    128 dual processor nodes. The ESSC's target priority usage on this system
    is 25% of it's overall future capacity.

    Test results indicate a potential for Lion-XC to run jobs up to 30% faster
    than Lion-XO. There is capacity for 5 researchers to purchase time on this

    Reactive Transport Modeling Workshop

    NSF  workshop: Expanding the role of Reactive Transport Modeling (RTM)
    within the Biogeochemical Sciences

     

    Dates and Location: April 13 – 15, 2014
    Embassy Suites Alexandria Hotel, 1900 Diagonal Road, Alexandria, VA 22314

    The workshop will bring together biogeochemists and reactive transport
    modelers to identify key interfaces between reactive transport modeling
    approaches and biogeochemical data collection and analysis. The specific
    goals of the workshop are to (1) identify the frontiers of reactive
    transport in the biogeochemical sciences, and (2) determine what
    educational and infrastructure development is required to achieve these
    goals.

    Contents:

      □ Motivation
      □ Workshop agenda
      □ One page white paper
      □ Contacts and organizers
      □ Workshop Logistics, Travel and Reimbursement
      □ RTM Survey

    We designed a survey to collect feedback from the community about the
    educational and development needs in the area of Reactive Transport
    Modeling for biogeochemical studies. It is a short survey and should take 5
    – 10 minutes to finish. Here is the link to the survey: http://
    kwiksurveys.com/s.asp?sid=tcxmlwthiqxop6t322104

    Motivation:

    The formation, operation, and evolution of Earth systems are complex due to
    the coupling of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the
    subsurface. Such coupling plays a pivotal role in the conversion of rock to
    soil, release of nutrients from minerals for ecosystem vitality, and
    cycling of biogeochemically important elements and contaminants. Data
    collection and analysis coupled with field observation have provided
    significant insights into the factors that determine the evolution of the
    critical zone. Mechanistic understanding and prediction of the intimately
    coupled processes, however, often requires advanced modeling tools that can
    integrate large and diverse data sets to quantify the effects of individual
    processes, while at the same time provide a window into the coupled
    processes that may control the overall system behavior.

    Reactive Transport Modeling (RTM) has been used at various research fronts
    for approximately three decades. It has been used to understand complex

    Critical Zone Seminar Series Highlights Earth Surface Research

     

    At Earth's surface, rocks interact with living organisms in the layer known
    as the Critical Zone. To support research on this zone, EESI partners with
    the Department of Crop and Soil Science to bring notable scientists to Penn
    State to share their Critical Zone (CZ) research.

    Listed below are the scientists who have presented their research as part
    of the Critical Zone Seminar series. A committee of CZ researchers at Penn
    State chooses at least one annual speaker for this series. Committee
    members include Jason Kaye and Patrick Drohan, both from Crop and Soil
    Sciences, and Jennifer Macalady and Tim White, both from Geosciences.

    Frontiers in Earth Systems Ecology Annual Seminar

     

    The "Frontiers in Earth Systems Ecology Annual Seminar" reflects EESI's
    commitment to interdisciplinary research and scholarship in this growing
    area.

    This seminar brings to Penn State a respected scientist who has made a
    significant contribution to the field of Earth Systems Ecology. The speaker
    is selected and nominated to the EESI Director or Associate Director by a
    committee of EESI associates and affiliates representing the departments of
    Energy and Mineral Engineering, Geography, Geosciences and Meteorology.

    The goals of this seminar series are to increase the visibility of Earth
    Systems Ecology in EMS and across campus and to highlight the disciplinary
    and interdisciplinary contributions of nominees.

    The speaker will give a seminar in one of the participating department's
    seminar series with departments rotating each year. That department has
    responsibility for hosting the speaker which includes organizing the
    speaker's calendar and identifying individual faculty, graduate students
    and undergraduate students across EMS, and the University to meet with the
    speaker. The speaker also may participate in classes across departments.

    EESI’s EarthTalks Seminar Series: Exploring Critical Environmental Issues

     

    EarthTalks LogoEarthTalks is EESI's semester-long interdisciplinary seminar
    series that seeks to engage the University and broader community in
    examination of some of the complex environmental challenges facing our
    world today.

    The weekly talks feature distinguished researchers and practitioners from
    Penn State as well as from other universities, government agencies and
    nonprofit organizations. Seminars are presented to both a live and online
    audience as well as archived with access through the EESI website.

    Recent EarthTalks series have been focused on the critical problems of
    climate change, protecting the planet's water resources and the
    environmental, technical, and social challenges presented by the
    development of the Marcellus Shale natural gas resource.

    EESI Faculty associates are encouraged to propose seminar topics of
    strategic interest to EESI to the EESI Director. EESI affiliates may also
    propose topics as appropriate. Faculty who propose topics are expected to
    develop the series in collaboration with a committee. The committee should
    include at least one member from an EMS Department other than the
    faculty-proposer and at least one member from a department in another
    college.

    EESI provides $5,000 in funding for EarthTalks as well as staff support to
    help with speakers' travel arrangements and campus schedules. Faculty are
    encouraged to leverage this support with funds from other units.

    The Dynamics of Deep Decarbonization
    Organizers: Seth Blumsack and Klaus Keller
    Co-Supported by: EESI, PESTL, CLIMA

    Achieving truly deep decarbonization is a uniquely difficult problem
    requiring fundamental changes in multiple interconnected systems (energy,
    agriculture, industry). Decisions made with the intent of avoiding the most
    severe climate change climatic impacts happen in the face of deep and
    dynamic uncertainties. Deep decarbonization decisions may also create
    multiple winners and losers and is thus a problem of managing social change
    in addition to technology transition. This EarthTalks series will invite
    prominent researchers to give talks on energy systems transition, negative
    carbon emissions, terrestrial sequestration, decision-making under
    uncertainty, and public policy relevant to deep decarbonization.

    Fall 2014 EarthTalks: Exploring the Oceans

    Mondays at 4:00 pm in 112 Walker Building

     

    Earth Talks: Exploring the Oceans seminar series is being developed to
    engage the Penn State community in marine research. Marine research is a
    highly interdisciplinary field that spans the wide breadth of Penn State's
    departments, colleges, and institutes. This seminar series is sponsored by
    EESI and PSIEE in conjunction with the Center for Marine Science and
    Technology. Typical seminar format will be two 20-min talks each week,
    except in the cases where invited speakers from off-campus will present a
    45-min presentation. The presentation slots are open to all Penn State
    faculty, researchers, and graduate students conducting research in the
    marine environment. Our hope is to schedule 2 different ocean topics within
    each seminar to attract those with diverse interests to listen, learn, and
    network. The seminar will cover topics from coastal to deep water
    environments, ocean technology, and ocean modelling.

    Spring 2012 EarthTalks Series: "Electronic Media and Environmental Science:
    e-Education to e-Data"

    Mondays at 4:00 pm in 112 Walker Building

     

    Electronic media are changing the way we use and find data to understand
    the environment. At the same time, the fraction of U.S. undergraduates that
    took at least one online course between 2000 and 2008 increased from 8-20%.
    Growth in electronic media are thus changing our lives as environmental
    scientists and educators and how we communicate with citizens outside the
    university. This EarthTalks colloquium series will present a slate of
    speakers who will address various aspects of how electronic media is
    changing how we teach and learn and explore the environment, and how this
    media is changing the research university. Speakers will span from local to
    global thinkers on the topic.

    Seminars & Conferences - Spring 2011 EarthTalks Series: "Managing Resources
    for Climate Change"

    Spring 2011 EarthTalks Series: "Managing Resources for Climate Change"

    Mondays at 4:00 pm in 112 Walker Building

     

    Planning how best to manage resources that will be affected by climate
    change is the topic of the Earth & Environmental Systems Institute's (EESI)
    spring EarthTalks seminar. Speakers from government agencies and nonprofit
    organizations are among those who will be addressing "Where Climate Science
    Meets the Road: Managing Resources for Climate Change."

    The speakers include:

      □ Nels Johnson, Deputy State Director for The Nature Conservancy, on
        Monday, Feb. 28
      □ Chris Pyke, Vice President of Research, U.S. Green Building Council;
        and Vice Chair, Chesapeake Bay program's Scientific and Technical
        Advisory Committee, on Monday, March 28;
      □ Daniel Vimont, Assistant Professor, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences,
        Center for Climatic Research, University of Wisconsin, on Monday, April
        4;
      □ Matt Larsen, Associate Director, Climate and Land Use Change, U.S.
        Geological Survey, on Monday, April 25.

    All talks will be held at 4 p.m., 112 Walker Building.

    In his talk, Johnson will focus on key findings of the recently completed
    Pennsylvania Climate Change Adaptation Planning Report that identifies the
    most important risks that climate change poses for the state's
    infrastructure, public health, natural resources and recreation and tourism
    industries. The report also indicates steps that can be taken now to reduce
    those impacts.

    "We provide current and relevant climate adaptation information to
    stakeholders including legislators, policy makers, government agencies and
    the public," said Johnson, who served as co-chair for the natural resources
    working group that prepared the report.

    Johnson also will highlight work by The Nature Conservancy to identify
    resilient landscapes and connectivity area in the central Appalachians.

    Seminars & Conferences - Fall 2010 EarthTalks Series: "Embracing Change:
    Resilience and Adaptation in Turbulent Times"

    Fall 2010 EarthTalks Series: "Embracing Change: Resilience and Adaptation
    in Turbulent Times"

    Mondays at 4:00 pm in 112 Walker Building

     

    "Embracing Change: Resilience and Adaptation in Turbulent Times" is the
    theme for the 2010 EarthTalks seminar series with scientists, policy makers
    and practitioners from across the nation and abroad joining Penn State
    faculty in discussions on visions for a more sustainable and equitable
    future.

    The 13-week series takes as a starting point that human activities are
    impacting ecosystems and climate in unprecedented ways and threatening the
    various resource bases that sustain both human and ecological well being.

    But rather than give in to doomsday scenarios, the speakers will argue for
    a different approach - resilience or the capacity to regenerate and revive
    after major changes or shocks have occurred.

    "Resilience is the concept that we are better off preparing for and
    adapting to an uncertain future now rather than learning by shock," said
    Petra Tschakert, EESI associate and series organizer.

    "While acknowledging that challenges, surprises and even chaos may lurk
    around the corner, resilience calls for embracing and working with change
    rather than trying to control it."

    Tschakert will lead off the series at 4 p.m. on Monday, August 30, in a
    talk titled "Participatory Learning for Climate Change Adaptation and
    Resilience." Free and open to the public, all talks will be in 112 Walker
    Building.

    Other speakers include Susanne Moser (Sept. 13), who has served as a staff
    scientist for climate change at the Union of Concerned Scientists and who
    is a review editor on the IPCC's Special Report on "Managing the Risks of
    Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation"; Lance
    Gunderson (Oct. 11), founding chair of the Department of Environmental
    Studies at Emory University and former executive director of the Resilience
    Network; and Byron "Ken" Williams (Oct. 18), chief of the Cooperative
    Research Units, U.S. Geological Survey, and lead author of the Department
    of Interior Adaptive Management Technical Guide.

    The 2010 EarthTalks series is sponsored by the Earth and Environmental
    Systems Institute (EESI), the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, the
    John A. Dutton e-Education Institute, the Department of Geography and the
    Penn State Institutes of Energy and the Environment (PSIEE).

    EESI Environmental Scholars

    In spring 2015, we initiated a revamped EESI Environmental Scholars program
    in the interest of forming connections between departments (and between
    research groups), increasing student diversity, and improving our
    recruiting efforts. The current EESI selection committee is comprised of
    Sridhar Anandakrishnan, professor of geosciences, Chris Forest, associate
    professor of meteorology, and Alan Taylor, professor of geography. Dr.
    Taylor is the current chair of the Committee. The Committee is charged with
    the following:

      □ Choosing a set of four Scholars competitively among the incoming and
        accepted graduate student applicants in the EESI-affiliated
        departments, and from EESI Associates initially (all PhD students)
      □ Sending out a call for nominations to EESI associates, and they will
        nominate a student (one who has been made an offer).
      □ The chair will make a ranked list based on the faculty members' summary
        of their qualifications, and the other committee members will advise.

    These Scholars will be part of a cohort of an ongoing recruitment tool that
    will eventually lead to a large enough group to have cohesion and impact.
    The scholars will be offered a $2K top-up in the first year. There will be
    few requirements if they do accept, though we will look for positive
    inducements (dinner, retreats, a cross-disciplinary seminar/lunch)

    The Committee Chair will send out an announcement early each spring to EESI
    Associates asking for nominations.

    When Jenni Evans mentions ensembles, she's not talking about music but
    tropical cyclones. Evans, professor of meteorology and director of the
    Institute for CyberScience at Penn State, takes an extensive approach to
    studying cyclones that begin in the tropics and then undergo structural
    changes as they move into the mid-latitudes.

    "We use really cool machine learning techniques to understand how to take
    150 forecasts of one storm at one time and to understand physically what
    those forecasts mean," Evans said. "We look at the U.S., Canadian, European
    and U.K. models. At the moment we don't use the Japanese or Australian
    models, but that's because we haven't gotten there yet."

    Meteorologists call the collection of forecasts an ensemble and use it to
    identify the range of possibility for a storm. For instance, if the models
    predict that a storm will go into the Gulf of Mexico and the ensemble says
    that the storm will not travel farther north than Georgia, then individuals
    are pretty safe in North Carolina and almost certainly safe in
    Massachusetts, Evans explained. She wants to use the ensemble data to
    improve storm forecasts.

    Evans is also working with Mark Ballora, professor of music technology, and
    researcher Alex Kowaleski to sonify hurricanes. Sonification involves
    mapping numbers to sounds, Evans said. She works with Ballora to assign
    different sounds to key components of hurricanes, such as wind speed, water
    temperature, symmetry, and latitude. For instance, they use a "whoop whoop
    whoop" to indicate the fastest windspeeds, and the whoops get faster as the
    winds speed up; they also use a "duh duh duh" sound to indicate latitude,
    and the sound gets deeper as the storm moves out of the tropics and passes
    over the cooler water of the higher latitudes. Building on this research,
    Evans is currently working with colleagues in Australia to apply
    sonification to climate change.

    Furthermore, Evans is working with faculty partners in the Department of
    Meteorology, former postdoctoral scholar Holly Hamilton, and PhD candidate
    Kelly Nuñez Ocasio to understand how African easterly waves form. African
    easterly waves are areas of relatively low atmospheric pressure that form
    over Africa when hot air from the Sahara Desert meets the cooler, more
    humid air from the tropical monsoon.

    Caitlin Teti has a blast when it comes to space exploration. And as the new
    education program coordinator for the NASA Pennsylvania Space Grant
    Consortium, or Space Grant, she gets to share her enthusiasm with other
    science and space fans.

    "When you hear people talk about NASA, it's always this really cool subject
    and their eyes light up," said Teti, who graduated in 2017 with a
    bachelor's degree in Earth science and policy from Penn State. "To help
    facilitate the connection between them and NASA is a really interesting
    part of my job."

    Teti connects individuals to NASA resources by coordinating outreach events
    that promote space and STEM education. She describes herself as a person
    who wants to hit the ground running when presented with a project that she
    finds exciting. That is just what she did shortly after starting with Space
    Grant in April. Teti took a leading role in organizing Penn State's Apollo
    11 50th anniversary events, which included a public rocket launch and a
    speaker and film event featuring former NASA astronaut James Pawelczyk,
    associate professor of physiology and kinesiology at Penn State. The events
    attracted more than 200 and 400 attendees, respectively.

    "Being able to put on these free events for the community is really nice,"
    she said. "I've done a lot of work with the communities inside and outside
    State College through a couple grant programs. Being able to give the
    communities free access to science events and inspiring the next generation
    of scientists and people who are interested in space has been my
    motivation."

    Teti has ample experience connecting people to science. Before joining
    Space Grant, she worked in various roles at the Shaver's Creek
    Environmental Center. She began as an intern while enrolled at Penn State
    and eventually assumed the role of on-site director of the center's Outdoor
    School, where she helped advance the program and develop the curriculum.
    She also managed 75 campers and 30 university student workers. Teti said
    she gained many skills at Shaver's Creek that she could not in the
    traditional classroom setting, like group management, leadership and
    effective communication – skills she uses in her role at Space Grant.

    This fall semester she looks forward to working with the undergraduate and

    As Earth and Environmental Systems Institute scientists engage in research
    to understand, predict and find solutions for the most compelling
    environmental issues of our time, Francisco Tutella draws on his experience
    as a writer and former educator to help them communicate their findings.

    As the Institute's public relations specialist, Tutellawrites compelling
    stories about the diverse topics studied by EESI researchers. Topics
    include climate change and prediction, greenhouse gas emissions, the impact
    of natural gas development on watersheds in the Marcellus Shale region, the
    use of the internet and social media to predict and respond to natural
    disasters, ice sheets and sea level change, environmental economics,
    critical zone science and climate risk management.

    "I have always been interested in science. Also, I like the challenge that
    science writing poses, of taking a complex topic and making it accessible
    to all readers," Tutella says. "Here at EESI I have the opportunity to
    learn more by interviewing the scientists about their groundbreaking
    research, and I have the pleasure of communicating their important findings
    to audiences across Pennsylvania, the nation and the world."

    In his spare time, Tutella likes to hike, kayak and read. He can spend
    hours in coffee shops and bookstores. He also writes fiction and poetry and
    dabbles in Italian translation.

    Prior to joining EESI in spring 2019, Tutella taught academic writing,
    literature, Italian and English as a second language in northeast
    Pennsylvania. He also worked as a freelance writer for Wilkes University,
    where he earned an MFA in creative writing and honed his science writing
    skills as a graduate assistant in the marketing and communications
    department.

    March 2019

    From solving a food crisis to changing how scientists understand the fossil
    record of early life on Earth, Julie Cosmidis sees big solutions under the
    microscope.

    Assistant professor of geosciences and principal investigator of The
    Biomineral Factory at Penn State, Cosmidis studies the processes by which
    bacteria form minerals, called biomineralization, and how scientists use
    these processes to identify the presence of life in the rock record. She
    also studies organomineralization, the role of organic materials in mineral
    formation.

    "These processes are important as they control the mobility and
    bio-availability of different elements in geochemical cycles," said
    Cosmidis. Her lab work focuses on the minerals phosphate, elemental sulphur
    and calcium carbonate.

    Phosphate is an important ingredient in fertilizer and can increase crop
    yields by 50 percent. Scientists expect that mining activity will deplete
    all natural phosphate reserves in the coming decades. Cosmidis thinks the
    bacteria responsible for kidney stones may hold the answer to this problem.

    Some types of kidney stones form when E. coli in the body turns urine into
    phosphate minerals.

    "All the phosphates that a human expels through urination equals the amount
    of the minerals we are mining from rocks that will soon be depleted,"
    Cosmidis said.

    She recreates the process in her lab using synthetic urine. Cosmidis wants
    to find a sustainable method for collecting phosphates from urine and then
    optimize the process so scientists can use waste to create fertilizer.

    Cosmidis also studies elemental sulfur and its role as a biosignature. A
    biosignature is a physical clue that suggests the presence of life.
    Elemental sulfur forms when bacteria interact with sulfides. Under a
    microscope the bacteria have a slender, threadlike shape. Scientists
    looking at fossilized records view this as proof of life in the past. This
    may not be the case, according to Cosmidis.

    When Sarah Ivory says she's found a goldmine, it's probably not what you'd
    expect. The paeloecologist and new Penn State professor of Geosciences
    finds treasure in a most unusual place – well-preserved piles of ancient
    animal droppings.

    Ivory's research involves the study of past ecosystem changes, and
    fossilized urine despots, also called middens, can provide valuable clues
    about ancient vegetation.

    "We name all the sites we find," Ivory said. "One was called the hyrax
    goldmine."

    Hyrax are small mammals that look like rodents, but are actually most
    closely related to elephants and manatees. Their habit of using the same
    spot to do their business over many generations can provide important clues
    about the past.

    Ivory is searching for preserved pollen samples that can tell a story about
    vegetation and climate thousands of years ago. That information can better
    inform future conservation strategies.

    This fall, Ivory will travel to Oman to conduct additional research.

    "We are going to be hiking through the desert, climbing cliffs and looking
    for fossilized urinary deposits," she said.

    Ivory recently joined Penn State as an assistant professor in the
    Department of Geosciences. She is also an associate in the Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute.

    She received her Ph.D. from the University of Arizona and worked there as a
    postdoctoral researcher and as a postdoctoral fellow at Brown University
    before coming to Penn State.

    "I'm very excited about coming to Penn State, because they seem to have a
    very strong promotion of and support for interdisciplinary research," she
    said. "I'm really looking forward to being in an environment where that's
    really valued.

    Sierra Melton dreams of being on ice. The Penn State graduate student
    studies glaciers and hopes to travel to Antarctica one day to see her
    subjects first hand.

    Her journey brought her to Penn State, where she is a first-year graduate
    student studying glaciology with her advisors Richard Alley and Sridhar
    Anandakrishnan.

    "I've known for a long time I wanted to do some sort of science," Melton
    said. "I feel geoscience is a really good combination of what I love and
    something that's very meaningful to society."

    Melton has been selected as one of the 2018-19 Earth and Environmental
    Systems Institute Environmental Scholars.

    The scholarships are offered annually to graduate students to form
    connections between departments in the College of Earth and Mineral
    Sciences, and to increase student diversity.

    Melton received her undergraduate degree at Colorado College in geology.
    She has a diverse background in geosciences thanks to a pair of summer
    undergraduate research experiences.

    She worked at the University of Texas Marine Science Institute studying
    nitrogen cycling in tidally influenced rivers and estuaries. At North
    Carolina State University, she worked with remote sensing equipment to
    study soil erosion at active construction sites.

    Along the way, Melton became interested in glaciology. The idea of studying
    a problem straight from the headlines – climate change and sea-level rise –
    appealed to her.

    "I decided that I wanted to focus on issues that are happening right now,"
    she said. "I also really decided that I would rather focus on the physics
    side and problems that can be looked at with remote sensing,"

    Melton learned more about glaciology while studying abroad in Copenhagen,
    and her instructors there discussed research opportunities back in the
    United States.

    A flood of data is available at our fingertips thanks to things like social
    media and the internet. This data can be helpful in predicting and
    responding to natural disasters, but finding the right information in the
    deluge can be time consuming and difficult.

    That's where new EESI associate Guido Cervone and his Geoinformatics and
    Earth Observation laboratory (GEOlab) come in to play.

    Cervone, associate professor of geoinformatics and associate director of
    the Institute for CyberScience, and his lab work to develop algorithms that
    can quickly analyze large amounts of data and incorporate useful
    information from social media feeds.

    The group is working to help flood prediction and response, to better
    understand short and long-term climate predictions for agriculture and
    energy forecasting and to collect data after environmental disasters like
    the 2011 Fukuskinma nuclear accident.

    "Our research is improving society's ability to forecast and respond to a
    range of research areas, including flooding and other natural disasters, as
    well as segments of the energy market, including solar and wind energy
    prediction," Cervone told Penn State news. "Our methodologies could
    ultimately have a big impact in both disaster response and our transition
    to renewable energies."

    In addition to his appointments in EESI and Geography and Meteorology and
    Atmospheric Sciences, Cervone is co-chair for the Research Computing
    CyberInfrastructure Executive Committee (RCCI) under the office of the Vice
    President for Research.

    He also holds the appointments of Affiliate Scientist at the National
    Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and Adjunct Faculty at the
    Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO), Columbia University. He serves as
    program co-chair for the Natural Hazards focus group of the American
    Geophysical Union (AGU) and Chair for the Education and Outreach advisory
    board of NCAR. In 2013, he received the 'Medaglia di Rappresentanza' from
    the office of the President of the Republic of Italy.

    Michele "Shelly" McCall hopes she's made the last few months a little
    easier for the people of the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute.

    "I'm a problem solver," she said. "I like solving problems, helping people
    and making their lives a little easier."

    Shelly was hired in June to be an administrative support assistant for
    EESI. She's done a little bit of everything since – planning events and
    coordinating calendars, providing office support to EESI centers, even
    acting as the unofficial face of the institute, greeting those who come
    through the doors in need of assistance.

    Now Shelly will be filling the institute's vacant financial coordinator
    position, where she will handle a range a financial responsibilities to
    help keep EESI running smoothly.

    She previously worked in administrative support at the Facilities
    Engineering Institute at the College of Engineering, a position she says
    prepared her for her next chapter.

    "She came to us with much of the basic financial knowledge and the
    experience needed in this new position," Tracy Bernier, EESI administrative
    support coordinator, said in announcing Shelly's new position. "We are
    excited that she wants to accept this new, challenging opportunity."

    Shelly said she is happy to stay in EESI and take on new challenges within
    the institute.

    "It's been interesting to see the environmental side of it," she said of
    her experiences in EESI. "That's what's been different for me."

    Recently married, Shelly lives with her husband and children in a home
    outside Centre Hall. Between them, the couple have five children, including
    three currently enrolled within the Penn State system.

    Odette Mina works quickly. It's a skill she honed through a career working
    for engineering consulting firms.

    Now she is bringing that work ethic to her new job, as managing director of
    the Energy and Environmental Sustainability Laboratories (EESL) at Penn
    State.

    "I'm pretty excited with how much we've been able to accomplish in just
    five months," said Mina, who joined EESL in February, becoming its first
    managing director.

    Mina has hit the ground running. In her first few months, she has helped
    set rates for the use of all EESL equipment and has pushed forward on a new
    website and other marketing materials to help raise the facility's profile.

    Funded by Penn State Institute of Energy and the Environment, EESL is a
    collection of high-tech laboratories located across campus. The goal is to
    give researchers shared access to equipment they may need to conduct their
    research, but might not have funding to purchase on their own.

    "We are a multi-user facility, open to all users across Penn State, other
    academic institutions and industry partners," she said. "We really provide
    state-of-the-art instruments they wouldn't necessarily have the ability to
    access if we didn't have these facilities available to them."

    EESL's impressive list of equipment includes instrumentation that can
    reveal the ages of ancient materials through high-precision carbon dating
    and that offer high-resolution 3-D imaging of objects, among many others.

    Managing all these labs may seem like a big job, but it's one Mina was
    ready for.

    "I managed laboratory services for commercial labs for many years, and then
    I managed environmental health and safety consulting services for many more
    years, she said. "So I have pretty strong experience in the business aspect
    of managing science and engineering, with a focus on laboratories."

    Mina had previously worked for about 30 years for engineering consulting
    firms. While she has a science background, receiving her bachelor's degree

    Their research focuses on a Native America tribal nation's forested home in
    Wisconsin, or on leaf fossils found in remote Patagonia, or perhaps even
    right in Penn State's backyard. But they have at least one thing in common
    – they are the 2017-18 Earth and Environmental Scholars.

    Stacey Olsen (Geography), Gabriella Rossetto (Geosciences) and Perri
    Silverhart (Geosciences) have been selected as this year's scholars. The
    scholarships are offered annually to graduate students to form connections
    between department in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, and to
    increase student diversity.

    Gabriella Rossetto (photo)And diverse is a good way to describe their
    research.

    Stacey Olsen is studying the impact that invasive species like the Emerald
    Ash Borer could have on the forests maintained by the Menominee people – a
    Native America tribal national in Wisconsin.

    Her work is part of a National Science Foundation funded project to study
    cultural and economic challenges climate change will play on the
    reservation, and how it could inform decision-making about forest
    management.

    "I was drawn to the project for its interdisciplinary nature, and because
    it also incorporates indigenous knowledge and values systems," Olsen said.

    Olsen uses ecological modeling software that can predict impacts of
    biological disturbances on the forest and analyze them against other
    factors, like a changing climate.

    Perri Silverhart (photo)Gabriella Rossetto's work finds her in far-away
    South America. She is studying the monkey puzzle tree, an endangered type
    of evergreen described as a "living fossil" due to the longevity of the
    species.

    record in South America," she said.

    Debbie Lambert does it all.

    From organizing workshops and seminars, to greeting guests as they come
    through the doors and answering their questions, to ordering the supplies
    that keep the office running smoothly, Lambert has been a
    jack-of-all-trades for the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute.

    Now, after more than 14 years with EESI and more than 22 with Penn State,
    Lambert is set to retire in June.

    "I'm a little worried the plants won't get watered after I'm gone," she
    said with a smile.

    Lambert wears many hats for EESI and is an invaluable member of the team,
    helping faculty, staff and visitors alike on any number or projects and in
    solving countless issues.

    She is the unofficial face of EESI, and those who work closely with her
    quickly appreciate her good humor and her depth of knowledge about the
    institute.

    Lambert worked at a number of positions at Penn State before coming to
    EESI, including the Department of Geosciences, where she was a staff
    assistant for now-EESI director Susan L. Brantley. Lambert was interested
    in working for EESI because of the new opportunities it presented.

    "I thought there would be new opportunities," she said. "I really did like
    geosciences, and I really missed working with the students. But I really
    like my job here. I'm very happy with greeting people and helping people."

    Coincidentally, Lambert was soon reunited with Brantley, who was appointed
    director of EESI. Brantley was replacing former director Eric Barron, who
    at the time had left the university but has since returned to become its
    president.

    Lambert said she can now look back on how much EESI has grown since she
    started at the institute. "It was on a much smaller scale than what it is
    now," she said. "It's really grown since then."

    March 2017

    From weather systems on the west coast of Africa to wildfires in
    California, a pair of Penn State graduate students are pursuing their
    passions – with some help from the Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute.

    Graduate students Kelly Nunez Ocasio (Meteorology) and Natalie Pawlikowski
    (Geography) are the 2016-17 EESI Environmental Scholars. The scholarships,
    offered each year, are partly aimed at forming connection between
    departments and increasing student diversity.

    For Nunez Ocasio, the work she is doing at Penn State hits close to home.
    She was raised in Puerto Rico, and lived through Hurricane Georges, a
    powerful Category 4 hurricane that caused significant damage throughout the
    Caribbean and along the Gulf of Mexico in 1998.

    "Ever since I was a kid I experienced tropical storms and hurricanes," she
    said. "I lived the impact of Hurricane Georges and how it affected everyone
    for months. So I was intrigued about how I can help my community."

    That journey brought her to Penn State, where she is studying weather
    systems that form in the West African region and potentially churn across
    the Atlantic Ocean and develop into hurricanes and tropical storms. She
    works with Jenni Evans, professor of meteorology and director of the
    Institute for CyberScience.

    "What I'm trying to do is better understand how these storms relate to the
    topography of Africa, the atmosphere," Nunez Ocasio said. "How do they
    become potential hazards? We want to be able to track them and understand
    them better to put this information in models and predictions to better
    prepare our society."

    Western African is a long way away from where Pawlikowski finds herself
    working. She spent last summer in California, where she studied how fire
    management strategies have changed forest composition in one area.

    "Alan Taylor (a Penn State geography professor) did a pretty extensive
    study of Beaver Creek Pinery in Northern California in 1998, and what I did
    was go out and help remeasure it to see how 20 years with no fires would

    Walk into the woods at Penn State's Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone
    Observatory, and it's hard to miss the science happening around you.
    Instruments and gages dot the hillsides and stream beds. Trees are numbered
    with markers and deep pits expose the layers of soil under the ground.

    The CZO is part of a National Science Foundation-funded project to study
    the thin, outer layer of Earth that sustains all human life.
    Interdisciplinary scientists measure everything from what nutrients trees
    take from their highest leaves to what happens where soil and bedrock meet
    deep underground.

    Dozens of pieces of equipment help scientists collect geochemical,
    geomorphological, ecological, LIDAR and soil data from the site. That's a
    lot of information, and managing it is no small task.

    That's where Dan Shapich comes in. Shapich, a data manager with EESI, is
    tasked with making the voluminous information gathered at the site
    available to researchers and the public through the CZO's website, http://
    criticalzone.org/shale-hills/.

    "It's a big job," Shapich said.

    Since starting at EESI in October, Shapich has been working with research
    assistant Brandon Forsythe to streamline how data is collected at the CZO,
    and in updating the website.

    "We are streamlining the data so it can go directly from the sensors right
    to our servers and be automatically displayed without us having to go out
    there manually and download it," Shapich said.

    That will help researchers get their information faster, and ensure the
    data they collect is online and available to the public.

    Shapich previously worked as a programmer in the College of Engineering. He
    received his undergraduate degree in Information Science Technology and his
    master's degree in Geospatial Intelligence from Penn State.

    He said he was drawn to EESI because of the data being collected at the CZO
    and the flexibility offered by the position.

    Terry Noll has seen a lot of Pennsylvania.

    The Penn State research assistant's work has taken her from the
    endless-mountain wilderness of Sullivan County, to the sweeping farmlands
    of Lancaster County, to the former coal country of Indiana County.

    One thing these diverse areas have in common: rural communities grappling
    with sudden changes and complex issues brought on by the Marcellus shale
    gas boom.

    And Noll has been there to talk them through it.

    For the last four years, Noll has served as project coordinator for an
    effort to educate rural Pennsylvanians about the changes taking place in
    their backyards.

    Her work has been part of Marcellus Matters: Engaging Adults in Science and
    Energy, a National Science Foundation-funded project that since 2012 has
    educated people in rural communities about science and energy through the
    lens of Marcellus Shale natural gas development.

    "Our project is geared toward providing the education to community members
    to empower them to develop the knowledge and critical thinking skills that
    will allow them to engage in civil dialogue within their communities as
    development occurs," Noll said.

    The program, which is winding down and ends in December, has reached
    hundreds in Clearfield, Clinton, Sullivan, Indiana, Lancaster and Lycoming
    counties.

    Interdisciplinary researchers from geosciences, arts and architecture,
    agricultural sciences and education traveled to the communities and taught
    residents about everything from the physical science behind unconventional
    shale gas drilling to the social and economic impacts of an energy boom and
    bust cycle.

    "I loved the interdisciplinary approach," said Noll, who led multiple-week
    programs in the communities. "We had landscape architects who understood

    Jaclyn Stimely quickly learned that the space grant program isn't just
    about astronomy and physics.

    "Our programming really is cross-disciplinary," said Stimely, who has been
    the administrative manager for the NASA Pennsylvania Space Grant Consortium
    (PSGC), housed within Penn State's Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute, since December. The PSGC is one of 52 across the country.

    Space Grant programming is aimed at helping future scientists and engineers
    pursue their passions. Stimely knows that can be a truly interdisciplinary
    endeavor.

    "We supported an early career biologist at St. Francis University who
    didn't have funding to continue her research through the summer," Stimely
    said. "She studied micro-organisms and the investigation of life in extreme
    environments."

    Perhaps that project stuck out for another reason. In college, Stimely
    studied biology at Arcadia University outside Philadelphia. When she
    relocated to the area, Stimely joined the Chemistry Department at Penn
    State, managing the graduate program. She accepted a job with the Space
    Grant program in December 2015.

    "It's a rewarding position," she said. "I get to work with different
    institutional programs across the state from the proposal stage to budget
    adjustments to program evaluation."

    PSGC provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at 15
    universities across the state, including Penn State. The Space Grant

    April 2016

    On any given day, you might find Brandon Forsythe trekking through the
    woods, wading in a babbling stream or paddling out on a lake.

    It might sound like a peaceful vacation, but for Brandon it's another day
    in the office.

    Brandon, an EESI research assistant, is responsible for maintaining the
    many instruments, gages and sensors out in the field that make up Penn
    State's Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory.

    It's no small task. There are hundreds of pieces of equipment in the CZO,
    located in Penn State's Stone Valley Forest. The technology measures
    everything from metrological and atmospheric parameters all the way down to
    measurements deep under the soil.

    There's a lot of equipment, and even more data being collected, aimed at
    better our understanding of the "critical zone," the thin outer layer of
    Earth that sustains life. The interdisciplinary work looks at the impact of
    water as it move from the canopy of trees through the top layer of the
    earth into the bedrock below, including the chemistry of those
    interactions.

    It's the collaborative nature of the project that drew Brandon to Penn
    State.

    "I like the interdisciplinary approach of this position," he said. "That
    was one of my biggest draws. There's a lot more involvement, lots of
    opportunities to learn."

    Brandon received his degree from Alaska Pacific University and worked for
    the US Geological Survey in Alaska conducting stream gaging and water
    quality sampling projects in that state. He later worked for the USGS in
    Pennsylvania before coming to Penn State.

    Nooreen Meghani is on the hunt for orphaned and abandoned wells.

    She got off to a good start on a recent trip to the Allegheny National
    Forest, finding a well long forgotten in the dark woods.

    "It's was like a treasure hunt," she said.

    That's one down – a couple hundred thousand to go. There are an estimated
    200,000 of these oil and gas wells scattered across Pennsylvania.

    Finding them is a big job, and that's why Meghani is turning to citizen
    scientists for some help. She is leading the charge to recruit volunteers
    who can be trained to research where wells might be, find them and monitor
    for potential environmental impacts.

    Nooereen Meghani at a well

     

    An estimated 325,000 wells have been drilled in Pennsylvania since 1859,
    when an oil boom began in the western part of the state. Almost 100 years
    elapsed before regulations in 1956 required wells to be documented, and the
    state only has record of about 125,000.

    With no records, it's difficult to find the remaining wells and to assess
    what kind of condition they are in. If damaged or not properly sealed,
    these wells pose environmental risks, both from greenhouse gases like
    methane that can escape into the atmosphere and from oil or gas that could
    affect freshwater aquifers.

    "On one hand, you are excited to look for these things," Meghani said.
    "Then you stop and think about what it is you're finding. One of the wells
    we found was shattered and there was just a piece of concrete sticking out
    of the ground. It's a little disturbing."

    Penn State is offering new tools to aid in the search - a forum to bring
    community members together and a website that can be used to document found
    wells and track data like well integrity at the surface. The information
    can be used to inform state Department of Environmental Protection

    EESI is one of the nation's leading earth and environmental science
    research institutes, and its diverse, renowned faculty is engaged in
    innovative studies on some of the most compelling issues of our time.

    But how do those researchers share their findings with the public and get
    the word out about the work they are doing? That's where Matt Carroll comes
    in. Matt is a writer who joined EESI in fall 2014. It's his job to write
    compelling and understandable stories based on the often complex research
    being done in EESI and to help publicize the institute.

    Matt will tackle a wide range of topics being studied by EESI scientists:
    the impact of climate change on glaciers in the Antarctic, and by
    extension, rising sea levels; the importance of wetlands; effective ways to
    measure greenhouse gas emissions; the potential for natural gas development
    in the Marcellus Shale region and the best ways to assess the potential
    impacts on water quality; how climate change can affect wildfires; and the
    potential for finding other habitable planets.

    "There's no shortage of fascinating stories in EESI," Matt said. "It's my
    passion to share important stories, and I know working with our researchers
    will give me to opportunity to do just that."

    Prior to joining EESI, Matt worked for several years as a reporter at the
    Centre Daily Times, where he worked a variety of beats, covering Penn State
    University, municipal and county governments and crime and courts.

    March 2015

    Penn State senior research associate Tim White plunged into the ice-covered
    Susquehanna River on a snowy Sunday in March.

    Swimming in 34-degree water might sound crazy to some, but it's exactly the
    type of training White needs to keep his skills sharp.

    It's the closest he's going to get to simulating conditions in Alaska,
    where White travels most years to conduct research off the coast.

    His work there focuses on a particularly warm period in Earth's history,
    the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, and what it can tell us about our
    future.

    Approximately 55 million years ago, during the PETM, the Earth was nearly
    free of icy glaciers and alligators could be found crawling in northern
    Greenland, White said.

    "By a fairly large group of scientists, it's thought to be the closest
    analogy to where the Earth is headed in the next 500 years or so," he said.
    "It was a very warm time, when all the information that we're capable of
    gathering suggests there was very little if any polar ice ... ."

    But bits of sediment found in the fossil record lead White think there may
    have been ice on the ocean after all, at least seasonally.

    If so, it could mean at least some ice formed on the ocean during a time
    when many believe there was little, if any, on the planet.

    "We really want to nail this stuff and be able to inform decision-makers in
    an accurate way," he said. "We need to be really confident in our
    reconstructions."

    Space grant programs at 13 universities, special scholarships for students
    and research awards for astrobiologists.

    Linda Bell has a hand in it all.

    Bell is administrative manager for the NASA Pennsylvania Space Grant
    Consortium and the Penn State Astrobiology Research Center, both of which
    are housed within the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute. The Space
    Grant program, aimed at helping future scientists and engineers pursue
    their passions, marked its 25th anniversary in 2013. In that year alone,
    the Pennsylvania program that Bell helps run awarded grants to about 400
    undergraduate and graduate students.

    Bell handles the budgeting from the beginning to the end, including
    proposals, making sure the plans stay on track, overseeing spending and
    trouble-shooting questions from students, faculty and staff. That could be
    students looking for guidance on their scholarships or faculty on the other
    side of the world running into trouble getting the freight they need for
    their research off a boat.

    "I enjoy working with the professors," Bell said. "I love collaborating
    with them and getting ideas. It's absolutely amazing what some of these
    consortia are doing. To go to national centers, like Goddard, and see what
    they're doing is absolutely mind blowing."

    The Pennsylvania Space Grant program is one of 52 across the country. The
    Space Grant programs include scholarship, fellowships and lab work for
    students at Penn State and other schools around the state. The work crosses
    colleges, drawing participants in Earth and Mineral Sciences, Education,
    Liberal Arts, Engineering and Health and Human Development.

    Among those programs is the Women in Science and Engineering Program
    (WISER), which matches female undergraduates at Penn State main campus,
    Altoona and Abington, Temple University and Gannon University with
    professors in science and engineering. About 80 professors are
    participating in this program.

    Bell's office also began managing the Astrobiology Research Center in 2013.
    In this position, she works with faculty and graduate students from Penn
    State and other schools including UCLA, Cal Tech, and the Arizona State
    University.

    Bell has worked in EESI since December 2007. Before that, she worked in the
    Smeal College of Business for 27 years.

    "I just love my job, it is as simple as that!" she said.

    Science, a topic difficult to understand for many. One of EESI's goals in
    the 2008-2014 strategic plan was hiring an interdisciplinary program
    coordinator/ professional writer to help EESI spread information about the
    work of EMS faculty and students in the environmental sciences.

    That's where Anne Danahy comes in. She is a writer who joined EESI in fall
    2012. She has a talent for creating fascinating understandable stories even
    if the topic is complex. Her repertoire is far-reaching. She writes about
    droughts and fires in the Amazon, about habitable planets,
    paleoceanography, birds and their environment, fracking and gas well
    flowback, politics, poverty, climate change and many more topics. She not
    only interviews scientists but also university presidents and trustees,
    school teachers and students and regular citizens.

    "One of the favorite parts of my job is talking with scientists and their
    students and learning about the research they're doing," Anne said. "Last
    week, I got to have a FaceTime chat with one researcher while he was on a
    summer program in Alaska, and go watch another researcher and his students
    do field work on vernal pools."

    In 2013 Anne was the recipient of the College of Earth and Mineral
    Sciences' Future Star Award. In addition to her job as science writer she
    teaches news writing and is a volunteer host of a Q&A program on the local
    cable television access station, C-NET.

    Prior to joining ESSI, Anne worked for about 12 years as a reporter at the
    Centre Daily Times.

    January 2014

    In the past few years, interest has grown concerning the "habitable zone"
    around the Sun and other stars. The habitable zone is the region in space
    where a rocky planet similar to Earth can maintain liquid water on its
    surface. We define it that way because life — all life that we know about,
    at least — requires liquid water during at least part of its life cycle.

    This topic has heated up in the last few years because NASA's Kepler Space
    Telescope has been counting planets in the habitable zones of other stars.
    Kepler monitored the brightness of approximately 160,000 stars continuously
    from 2009 to 2013, ending when it lost a critical reaction wheel
    (gyroscope) and could no longer point accurately. During that time, Kepler
    detected over 3,500 planets orbiting more than 2,600 stars. Kepler found
    planets by looking for the slight decrease in a star's brightness when a
    planet passes in front of it. Of the 3,500 detected objects, about two
    dozen are rocky planets orbiting within the habitable zones of their parent
    star.

    Before the grants and contracts that support research projects in the Earth
    and Environmental Systems Institute can be submitted, many have to cross
    Brad King's desk.

    Now, as part of a six-month administrative fellowship, King, associate
    coordinator of grants and contracts, is learning about what happens once
    faculty and researchers are awarded funding from federal, state and
    industry sponsors.

    "In my job, I'm on the other end of the spectrum. I deal with everything
    until we get the award or grant," said King, whose position is with the
    Associate Dean for Graduate Education and Research Office in the College of
    Earth and Mineral Sciences. "What made me want to do this administrative
    fellowship was to see what they're doing with the grant once they got it."

    Through the EMS fellowship program, staff interested in expanding their
    expertise by working with mentors in other offices and units can apply to
    become fellows. King is working with Deb Detwiler, the administrative
    assistant in EESI who coordinates research proposals and administers grant
    awards; and Tracy Bernier, administrative assistant to EESI Director Sue
    Brantley.

    "I wanted to broaden my administrative knowledge, and I think learning the
    post-award side of things will help me help the researchers on the
    pre-award side too," King said.

    On average for the past three years, EESI faculty and researchers have
    submitted 66 proposals a year. That funding supports research across a
    range of subjects from the behavior of ice sheets in the Antarctic to
    ancient leaves buried in forests and streams. Current EESI projects include
    a $12 million National Science Foundation award for the Sustainable Climate
    Risk Management initiative, and $5 million from the NSF for the Susquehanna
    Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory.

    King started his job in EMS in November 2010 after graduating from Penn
    State with a bachelor's in labor studies and employment relations. He had
    at one point majored in professional golf management — but found that
    wasn't his calling.

    Fresh fruit? How about a 52.2 million-year-old tomatillo.

    That's what Peter Wilf, professor of geosciences and an EESI associate,
    found as part of his work in Argentina. Information on the discovery caught
    the attention of the media when Wilf presented it at the Geological Society
    of America meeting in Denver.

    "Though flattened, the ancient fruit ... looks remarkably like a modern
    version of the popular salsa ingredient," Live Science notes in a story
    about the finding.

    The discovery is part of the work Wilf, professor of geosciences at Penn
    State, and other researchers are doing in Laguna del Hunco in Argentina.

    "There's so much left to discover," Wilf remarked in a radio interview with
    KPCC on the topic.

    Conducting research presents challenges, but turning the data into
    understandable information can be its own puzzle.

    Cyberspecialist Dan Arthur joined EESI in May to work with faculty and
    researchers on doing that - finding ways to make their research and data
    accessible to others. That includes working with the Susquehanna Shale
    Hills Critical Zone Observatory project on data management, data
    presentation and promoting CZO activities.

    A recent example is the animated graphic that shows the Penn State
    Integrated Hydrologic Model. The model is used to predict soil saturation
    levels in the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone, a federally funded
    research initiative.

    Before joining EESI, Arthur worked at Purdue University as a graduate
    research assistant in atmospheric science, and before that, he was
    worldwide support manager for broadcast editing and webcasting products at
    Pinnacle Systems Inc.

    He spent 15 years in video production, support and management for
    manufacturing of broadcast video editing hardware. Arthur also has
    experience in software applications and data management.

    He has a master's degree in information and communication science from Ball
    State University and a master's in atmospheric science from Purdue. His
    atmospheric science research involved simultaneous visualization of radar
    and aircraft probe data - which are very different in scale - in 3D, as
    well as using numerical models and field observations to investigate cloud
    and precipitation processes.

    In his current position, Arthur can work with faculty and researchers on
    projects such as creating educational and promotional videos, database
    management, generating computerized plots and assisting with creating
    visual representation of data.

    If a community wanted to cut its greenhouse gas emissions and decided to
    take steps to do it, how would it know if the steps it was taking worked?

    A team of researchers from Penn State's College of Earth and Mineral
    Sciences and several other universities has been testing a method for doing
    that, by capturing readings of greenhouse gases in an urban atmosphere.
    Known as INFLUX, The Indianapolis Flux Experiment uses a combination of
    measurements taken on towers and readings from aircraft to find out how
    much carbon dioxide and methane is being emitted from the city.

    "It is an independent way to quantify emissions levels and later validate
    changes and reductions. We hope to demonstrate this and learn what is
    required to make this work," said Ken Davis, professor of meteorology at
    Penn State and a lead researcher on the project.

    The results are expected to provide data that could be used to establish
    standards for measuring greenhouse gas emissions. The project will document
    the accuracy of the method, and establish open data records that will allow
    for independent verification of the findings.

    The Penn State team's part of the project includes deploying and operating
    the sensors that are distributed across the metropolitan region on 12
    communications towers and are designed to measure the greenhouse gases
    carbon dioxide and methane. The towers also host measurements of carbon
    monoxide and other tracers of industrial activity to help identify the
    sources of the greenhouse gases. That data is being coupled with
    measurements taken during 40 flights over the area and with information
    about buildings and their estimated individual energy usage.

    Davis said the expression "the atmosphere can't lie" is true in cases like
    this where the atmosphere records the earth's emissions. The tower-based
    sensors offer an independent way to measure changes in emissions, including
    whether reductions are taking place.

    Davis explained that this method is really quite simple: As air flows
    across the city, emissions accumulate in the atmosphere. By measuring this
    accumulation and quantifying the wind speed and atmospheric mixing, the
    researchers can infer the emission rates.

    Who could find fault with Smokey the Bear, the gentle Ursus whose advice
    many Americans grew up following? Perhaps the spotted owl, for starters. To
    flourish, the endangered bird that's native to the western United States
    needs certain types of forests that aren't found in places where severe
    wildfires have occurred.

    Smokey, of course, encourages people to take steps to prevent fires, not
    start them. But, suppression of naturally occurring blazes can have
    unintended consequences. Whether those include increasing the possibility
    for wildfires to become severe has been the focus of research Alan Taylor,
    Penn State professor of geography, recently completed.

    Taylor's study focused on a mixed conifer forest in part of the Lassen
    National Forest in northern California known as the Cub Creek Research
    Natural Area that was the site of a wildfire in 2008. The unusual history
    of that preserved area that has never been logged allowed Taylor to look at
    whether a forest would burn the same way in two different time periods:
    one, in the 1880s, before fire suppression policy took effect, and the
    other in 2008 after it was being practiced.

    Taylor said that, in general, the burning patterns were similar, but with
    an important difference.

    "We lost more of the forest in the valley bottom because of the changes
    caused by fire suppression," Taylor said. "We lost 20 to 25 percent more
    than expected of the large, older growth trees."

    What the research found, through a combination of analyzing satellite data
    and field measurements, is that the high severity portions of the 2008 fire
    affected not only younger forests on upper slopes and ridgetops where they
    had burned severely in the 19th century but older more diverse forests in
    the valleys that had escaped high severity fire in the past. Tree ring
    dating of fire scars show that forests in the valley had burned many times
    in the past 300 years but not severely.

    "Historically, fires operated in a way that tended to be less severe in
    valley bottoms and lower slopes," Taylor said. "Now, because of fire
    suppression, they tend to burn at a higher severity and you lose that
    habitat."

    A 100 foot core extracted from the south ridge of the Shale Hills CZO
    catchment in central Pennsylvania was one of the items on display at Penn
    State's Earth and Environmental Systems Institute recently during this
    year's Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory "All Hands"
    meeting.

    The Penn State project – known as SSHCZO – is focused on a section of Stone
    Valley in Huntingdon County. It's part of a National Science Foundation
    initiative aimed at understanding the "critical zone" – the Earth's outer
    skin that sustains life.

    The May meeting of faculty, students and post-doctorate researchers who are
    part of the Penn State project included an opening seminar by invited guest
    Kip Solomon, a groundwater hydrologist at the University of Utah,
    presentations on the latest research and a poster session. The core on hand
    was drilled from a section of the Rose Hill Shale and will provide
    researchers with a way to investigate the chemistry and mineralogy of that
    section of earth and how it changed over time.

    Other presentations this year included observations of the groundwater
    beneath the Shale Hills CZO; a profile of shale soil, micrometeorology at
    Shale Hills and a new approach to quantifying the pore structure of rocks.

    "The 'All Hands' meeting gives the faculty, students and post-doctorates
    who are part of the CZO a chance to share their recent activities and
    findings with each other and discuss their new ideas and next steps," said
    Jennifer Williams, a research assistant at Penn State and program and data
    coordinator of SSHCZO.

    The SSHCZO includes nine faculty, five post-doctoral researchers, eight
    graduate students and three undergraduates. It is one of six projects that
    are part of the national initiative.

    December 2012

    Sridhar Anandakrishnan is away for the winter holiday, somewhere summer is
    in full swing -- an ice sheet at the end of the earth.

    The Penn State professor of geosciences is leading the University team
    that's part of a project on the Pine Island Glacier, an extension of the
    Antarctic ice sheet. The goal of the National Science Foundation-funded
    initiative is to get a better understanding of how the glacier, the ocean
    and the ice shelf are interacting, and what that could mean if water
    temperatures rise.

    The project includes teams from NASA, the University of Alaska, New York
    University, the Naval Postgraduate School and the British Antarctic Survey.
    It's the first of its kind to focus on the Pine Island Glacier, a remote
    region that can only be reached a few months a year in an airplane that
    lands on skis.

    "It's a pretty spectacular spot," Anandakrishnan, a faculty member in Penn
    State's Earth and Environmental Systems Institute, said before leaving
    campus to join doctoral student Kiya Riverman and research associate Leo
    Peters, who are part of his team.

    Riverman and Peters arrived at the site – literally a camp on the ice –
    after Thanksgiving. If the weather cooperates, Anandakrishnan is traveling
    first to McMurdo Base on Ross Island and from there will communicate with
    the team at Pine Island Glacier.

    An ice shelf is an extension of the Antarctic ice sheet, but, unlike the
    ice sheet, ocean water flows in the cavity underneath the shelf.
    Anandakrishnan compared the cycle of melting and freezing that goes on to a
    bank account: Snowfall gradually adds to the glacier, which in turn flows
    out to the ocean, leading to "withdrawals" from the account. When it snows,
    more ice goes back into the bank account.

    "If the cycle is nicely balanced, everybody is happy," he said.

    But if more ice flows out into the ocean than snow goes back into the
    glacier, that means a rise in the sea level. If temperatures climb, one
    possibility is that the melting ice shelves – floating extensions of the
    ice sheet – will shrink and provide less of a buffer between the ocean and

    David Pollard's work is taking him back in time five million years, not
    only to learn about the past but also what could be coming in the future.

    Pollard, a senior scientist in Penn State's Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute, is developing computer programs that can model the behavior of
    ice sheets in the past, and from that gain insight into what upcoming
    generations could see.

    "Understanding how ice sheets have responded in the past can help to
    predict how they will respond to future warming and contribute to sea level
    rise and flooding," Pollard said.

    The computer model Pollard created simulates how the Antarctic ice sheet
    has advanced and retreated over the last 5 million years. He notes that one
    sector, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, rests on bedrock far below sea level
    and is particularly vulnerable to warming ocean temperatures. The model
    code describes not only the current characteristics of the ice sheet – such
    as the velocity of ice flow and temperatures of the ice – but also
    simulates how the ice extent and thickness change over time.

    To assess the accuracy of the model, Pollard, along with Robert DeConto, a
    professor at the University of Massachusetts, compared its results to
    actual geological data from the multinational ANDRILL project gathered by
    drilling into sediments below floating ice fringing West Antarctica. The
    natural variations of the ice sheet simulated by the model corresponded
    well with the stacked layers in the sediment cores over the last 5 million
    years, allowing scientists to expand the relevance of the data beyond the
    local drill site to the entire region of West Antarctica.

    Now, Pollard is focusing the model on a smaller region of the West
    Antarctic coast that includes Pine Island Glacier, an area where the ice
    has begun to dramatically thin and flow faster in recent decades. By
    zooming in on a small region, the spacing between model grid points can be
    finer, improving the details of the simulations. Other researchers at Penn
    State and elsewhere are also paying close attention to Pine Island and
    nearby glaciers (http://live.psu.edu/story/63448 -- Link expired).

    Pollard's model includes the warming effects of both ocean and atmospheric
    temperatures. Ocean temperatures affect the ice via floating ice shelves —

    EESI High Performance Computing Resource

    For the last ten years now EESI has offered priority access to large high
    performance computing resources subsidized by various funded research
    efforts and run through the Research Computing and Cyberinfrastructure
    group (formerly known as GEaRs).

    Lion-xo remains available well past the orginally intended end of its
    operational life. This resource was primarily funded by the now defunct
    Center for Environmental Kinetic Analysis (CEKA).

    Lion-XC is still in the prime of its operational life and should be
    available for several more years. This resource was funded by the Earth
    System Science Center and EESI.

    And Lion-XF is the newest HPC cluster that was brought online in 2012. This
    resource was funded by David Pollard and EESI. Lion-XF will be available
    only to a limited number of researchers.

    EESI associates who are interested in using these HPC resources may request
    access through John Miley.

    These collaborations have been highly successful and on average we have had
    more computing capacity than we could consume.

    For the future, individual researchers with small scale HPC needs are
    encouraged to contact the RCC high performance computing group directly to
    discuss how you can work with that group to best meet your needs: https://
    ics.psu.edu/about/

    This contact will typically result in a meeting with the HPC group's
    director who can then advise you on how to best spend your grant money. If
    you choose to spend your research dollars with them and become a partner
    you will still receive priority access to whatever cluster you buy into and
    you will get exceptional support.

    If you have an existing relationship with us for HPC from a grant funded
    prior to 2009, nothing has changed for you. You may continue just as you
    have been until that grant is gone or you no longer require access. If you
    have any potential future large scale HPC needs we'd like to talk to you
    about how we might be able to work together and subsidize your efforts for
    the good of our local computing community.

    The Initiative for Energy and Environmental Economics and Policy (EEEP) was
    established in 2011 with the goal of promoting policy-relevant economics
    research that lies at the boundary between economic sciences and the study
    of natural or engineered systems. The EEEP initiative is focused primarily
    on the union between energy systems and environmental management and the
    development of quantitative tools to address decision challenges in these
    areas. As an initiative, our goal is to catalyze research in energy and
    environmental systems economics across the University and to build a
    world-class group of economists with interests in interdisciplinary
    collaboration.

    EEEP operates as a University-wide initiative with support provided by the
    Earth and Environmental Systems Institute, Penn State Institutes for Energy
    and the Environment, and the Environment and Natural Resources Institute.

    Examples of research in energy and environmental systems economics at Penn
    State include:

      □ electricity markets, the smart grid, integrating renewable electricity,
        and cyber-security in energy infrastructures;
      □ economic impacts and risks associated with global climate change;
      □ the design and implementation of energy-efficient building systems;
      □ valuation of ecosystem services;
      □ implications of Marcellus Shale natural gas development for energy
        markets and environmental quality;
      □ global markets for rare earth minerals.

    EEEP activities include a periodic seminar series featuring internal and
    external speakers, and an Initiative Affiliate program for students and
    faculty. Affiliates are eligible for small research and travel grants from
    the Initiative.

    Call for Center Proposals

    Earth and Environmental Systems Institute (EESI)

    Due date: April 17, 2017

     

    Call for Proposals for Centers

    We seek proposals from EESI associates for new Initiatives or Centers, and
    renewal proposals for existing Centers within EESI. Proposers are
    encouraged to read the University guidelines (RAG05) concerning Center
    status on EESI's website (https://policy.psu.edu/policies/RAG05).
    Initiatives should be proposed especially for activities that are likely to
    be eligible to become Centers as described by the university guidelines.

    What is an EESI Center or an EESI Initiative?

    A Center or Initiative within EESI represents a focus of interdisciplinary
    research and educational activities fostered by EESI associates and
    affiliates. In general, such a focus generally starts as an Initiative
    (this step can be approved by the EESI Director) and then progresses to
    become a Center (the step must be approved by the Senior Vice President for
    Research). Current Centers/Initiatives that are receiving EESI funding
    include the Center for Climate Risk Management (CLIMA), Center for
    Environmental Informatics (CEI), Earth System Science Center (ESSC), Penn
    State Ice and Climate Research Center (PSICE), Center for Landscape
    Dynamics (CLD), Energy and Environmental Economics and Policy Initiative
    (EEEP), and Riparia. These Centers receive anywhere from $5000 to $15,000
    per year for Center activities. Centers target one or more of the following
    goals over the three-year lifetime of the Center:

      □ promote interaction among faculty, students, and staff in a growing
        interdisciplinary field within the environmental sciences/engineering/
        social sciences
      □ promote excellence in scientific research, especially aligned with
        EESI's strategic plan
      □ promote access to computers, analytical instrumentation, or field sites
      □ foster the securing of extramural funding for multi-PI projects
      □ promote educational opportunities for students in environmental
        sciences and engineering, with special attention to udents from
        under-represented groups

    EESI Centers and Initiatives

    Scholar in Resident (SIR) Faculty Program

    The Scholar in Residence (SIR) for EMS faculty is a professional
    advancement grant in research or teaching for outstanding EESI Associates
    and Affiliates. The Departments of the recipients receive support for a
    semester to allow the Associate to focus on the scholarship of research or
    teaching and learning in the interdisciplinary environmental sciences.
    Depending on the available support, Scholars will reside (i.e. have office
    space in) in EESI during the academic year of, or the year after, a
    successful application.

    The SIR program targets support to individuals pursuing work of strategic
    interest to EESI as outlined in the EESI Strategic Plan. EESI offers
    $10,000 to the department of the Scholar-in-Residence to release each
    recipient from all classroom teaching responsibilities for the semester in
    exchange for residence in EESI. The SIR recipient must be in residence in
    the Earth and Engineering Science Building during the semester. During the
    award period, the recipient will also serve in an advisory capacity to the
    Director of the Institute.

    An acknowledgement of the SIR in any publications or material developed for
    distribution is expected (e.g. research was undertaken when the author was
    an EESI Scholar-in-Residence (January-July, 2010).

     

    How to Apply

    Applicants should submit a statement describing the proposed work
    (including the timing) and how a SIR grant would contribute to these
    activities, their most current curriculum vitae, a letter of support from
    their department head, and their most current faculty activity report.
    Individuals are encouraged to contact Susan L. Brantley (sxb7@psu.edu) to
    discuss their plan for use of a SIR before developing their proposal. The
    application for a SIR can be submitted by mail or email to Susan L.
    Brantley (sxb7@psu.edu), Director, Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute, 2217 EES, Penn State University, University Park, PA 16802.

     

    Fall 2009 Scholar in Residence Recipients are:

      □ Dr. Eric Kirby, Associate Professor of Geosciences
      □ Dr. Douglas Miller, Director of the Center for Environmental
        Informatics and Associate Professor Geography

    Research - Environmental Student Ambassador (ESA) Program

    EESI Centers and Initiatives

    Environmental Student Ambassador (ESA) Program

    EESI is seeking EMS undergraduate students interested in enhancing
    environmental stewardship and outreach in the University community and
    beyond to become Environmental Student Ambassadors.

    Funds are available to support the activities of an ESA by applying with a
    faculty sponsor in your EMS department. ESAs will be selected on the basis
    of a proposed project that improves the health and sustainability of the
    environment for the local community, for EMS, or for the University. The
    projects could, but are not required to, be executed in collaboration with
    University units (e.g. Physical Plant, the Arboretum at Penn State),
    student clubs (e.g. Ecoaction), community groups (e.g. ClearWater
    Conservancy, Millbrook Marsh), or an environmental group (e.g. Nature
    Conservancy, SIerra Club). Projects could focus on, for example, developing
    new educational or outreach materials for the public, improving the carbon
    footprint, recycling, energy audits, or removing invasive species in
    conservation areas.

    Environmental Student Ambassadors will receive financial and staff support
    for their activities for a semester but longer projects will be considered.

    Student ambassadors will need a faculty sponsor who is willing to serve as
    a mentor during the implementation of the project. The ESA could become
    part of a student curriculum by registering for independent study credits
    in consultation with their faculty mentor. ESAs are also expected to share
    project results with the EESI community at an informal lunch.

    EESI has allocated $2,500 annually to support the activities of the ESA
    program. Salary support will not be provided for the ESA. Acknowledgment of
    the ESA in any presentation or educational/outreach materials developed for
    distribution is expected.

    Applications to become an Environmental Student Ambassador should include:

      □ A two-page statement describing the proposed project and how it will
        enhance environmental stewardship and outreach in the University
        Community
      □ A schedule of activities and project deliverables
      □ A budget that identifies how funds will be spent
      □ A letter of support from a faculty sponsor
      □ Letters of support from any collaborating partners<

    Applications will be accepted at anytime during a semester for projects in
    the following semester(s). Please submit your application to: Tracy

    Research - Funding for Workshops

    EESI Centers and Initiatives

    Funding for Workshops

    EESI will provide funding for short focused workshops to enable groups of
    researchers to interact to move key ideas forward to increase the impact of
    research programs or to position research programs to lead in emerging
    areas of interdisciplinary environmental science. In its role as a leading
    environmental institute, EESI is well-positioned to facilitate workshops
    that support the research programs of our EESI Associates and Affiliates.

    Workshop structure:

    EESI seeks proposals from EESI Associates to run small workshops to support
    their research programs. Workshop proposals can fall into one of three
    categories:

     1. Proposals for scientific workshops that are tightly focused. Topics
        should be both timely and of interest to a group of EESI Associates and
        Affiliates that reside in different academic units at Penn State, and
        to scientists at other institutions.
     2. Proposals for workshops designed to bring together a group of
        prospective PIs to develop multi-disciplinary research proposals.
     3. Proposals for workshops supported by extramural funds that will utilize
        EESI facilities or EESI staff.

    Considerable flexibility is given to how the workshops will be run.
    Workshops with the following characteristics are especially encouraged:

      □ limited duration (likely 1 – 1.5 days)
      □ focused on a disciplinary or topical area consistent with EESIs mission
      □ limited size (~20 or fewer participants)
      □ inclusive of junior researchers (senior graduate students and postdocs)
        as well as a diversity of groups

    A steering committee of at least 3 people is expected to participate in
    developing and running proposed workshops.

    EESI can fund one workshop per calendar year and any EESI Associate is
    eligible to submit a proposal. Proposals will be evaluated by the EESI
    Advisory Committee. Individuals are encouraged to contact Sue Brantley (
    brantley@essc.psu.edu) to discuss their workshop idea before developing a
    proposal. Proposals that further EESI strategic goals as summarized in the
    Strategic Plan, proposals that involve multiple EESI Associates, and
    proposals that are co-sponsored by other units on campus are particularly
    encouraged.

    Purchasing Card Questions and Answers

    Q: How will I know if my p-card expenses require a p-card support form or
    will be included as part of my travel expenses?

    A: A good way to check is by logging into ERS and reviewing your imported
    expenses. These expenses will normally be included as part of a travel or
    meal reimbursement report and require either a travel reimbursement
    worksheet or a group meal/meeting form.

    Q: When I register for a conference or workshop on my p-card, do I need to
    complete a p-card support form for this expense even though it is part of
    my conference expenses? Why is this not part of the travel form that I
    submit after completion of my trip?

    A: The expenses are filtered either into the ERS System or into the IBIS
    Financial System, based on the merchant code of the vendor. Normally,
    vendors who coordinate the registrations, have a merchant code that the
    system filters into the IBIS system which requires a p-card support form.

    Shale Network drill pad photoThe workshop will be held May 16 and 17 at the
    Nittany Lion Inn in State College, Pa. The theme of this year's workshop is
    "Monitoring Communities and Their Environment."

    The workshop provides an opportunity for citizen scientists, researchers,
    government officials, energy company representatives, and environmental
    professionals to compare lessons learned about water and environmental
    issues within areas where shale energy development is occurring.

    The 2019 workshop features a field trip to two shale energy-related sites
    that manage solid and liquid wastes derived from well drilling and oil and
    gas production. The first is a tour of the Eureka Resources Williamsport,
    Pa. facility, an oil and gas wastewater management plant. This facility is
    designed for the pretreatment, recycling and disposal of wastewater from
    natural gas drilling and production operations in the Marcellus and Utica
    Shales. The second is a tour of the Wayne Township Landfill in Clinton
    County, Pa. The landfill manages drilling cuttings and muds generated
    primarily from shale well drilling operations and uses some novel practices
    to minimize the industry's environmental footprint. In addition, the
    facility hosts a compressed natural gas filling station for vehicles,
    including trash hauling vehicles.

    2017 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    Living Filter Corn Irrigation

    February 2017

    UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa -- Changes in climate can rapidly impact even the
    deepest freshwater aquifers according to Penn State and Columbia University
    hydrologists.

    The researchers found that responses to climate variations can be detected
    in deep groundwater aquifers faster than expected - in many cases within a
    year.

    Living Filter Corn Irrigation

    Because rain water may take years to reach deep aquifers through natural
    infiltration, the findings suggest another factor is involved, such as
    pumping of aquifers done by agricultural industries.

    "We saw a rapid response in deep groundwater levels to both major climate
    cycles and local precipitation," said Tess Russo, associate in Penn State's
    Earth and Environmental Systems Institute. "These aquifers are so deep, we
    expect it takes years for precipitation to make its way down, so if it's
    not natural recharge causing the response of groundwater to changes in
    precipitation, then it may be coming from pumping changes."

    The research, published in Nature Geoscience, sheds new light on
    groundwater budgets in the U.S. and better defines how water held in deep
    aquifers could change with the climate. Groundwater used by municipalities
    and industry is almost always drawn from deep wells, which provide a more
    reliable source of water than shallow aquifers, especially during times of
    drought.

##  News Archive 2016 - Leaf study brings boom to CZO

    Leaf study brings boom to CZO

    October 2016

    UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa -- It wasn't hunting season, but a Penn State
    researcher took aim at the target and fired. Nothing moved except some
    leaves floating gently to the ground – a perfect shot.

    Leaf study brings boom to CZO

     

    It was those leaves that Penn State graduate student Lillian Hill and her
    team were after earlier this year when they trekked out into the woods with
    a shotgun. It may seem unusual, but it's actually a common method to bring
    down samples that grow high in the canopy – called sun leaves.

    It's those hard-to-reach leaves that Hill needs. She is studying what
    nutrients trees take from their leaves before dropping them, and what that
    process can tell us about what's happening underneath.

    "Plants suck up whatever is in the soil that they need, and they put it in
    their leaves to do the types of reactions they need to keep themselves
    going," Hill said.

    Before the leaves fall, plants resorb any nutrients they need to reserve
    for the next year. If they take back a specific nutrient, it might mean
    they are not getting enough from the soil.

    "That's why we are looking at older canopy trees, they kind of learn what
    to resorb," Hill said, whose advisors are Jason Kaye, professor of soil
    biogeochemistry, and Roman DiBiase, assistant professor of geosciences and
    associate in the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute at Penn State.

    Hill will head back out to the woods this month to collect more samples.
    Her job will be much easier, thanks to the changing seasons. Hill will take
    the live leaves she previously collected, and the dead leaves she'll find
    this fall, run them through equipment in the lab, and compare nutrient
    content.

    Her work can tell us what nutrients are missing from the soil and therefor
    what is limiting trees' growth in any particular location. This can also
    offer researchers information about the soil and bedrock underneath are
    interacting.

    Hill is comparing limiting nutrients at locations with shale bedrock and
    sandstone found within Penn State's Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone
    Observatory.

    "We're also taking soil samples out here at multiple depths and analyzing
    that for the same suite of nutrients," Hill said. "That gives us an idea if
    there is a difference in nutrient limitation between sandstone and shale.
    That's my big question."

    The sites are part of Penn State's CZO, one in a network funded by the
    National Science Foundation that links diverse geographical locations
    across the U.S. where researchers are studying the thin layer that supports
    all human life. Dr. Susan L. Brantley, Distinguished Professor of

    CZO hosts Summer Scholars

    CZO Summer Scholars walk in Researchers' shoes

    September 2016

    UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa -- If you need directions around the sloping, forested
    hills near Penn State's Shaver's Creek Environmental Center, just ask
    Connor Martin.

    CZO REU Summer Scholar 2016

    Summer CZO REU students and Penn State researchers run an experiment to
    test soil infiltration rates at the Garner Run site in Penn State's
    Susquehanna Hills Critical Zone Observatory (CZO). The team hoped to
    compare the numbers to infiltration rates over rocky sections of the site.

     

    Martin spent his summer trekking through the woods -- pencil, maps and GPS
    unit in hand. He was part of a team mapping the ground cover, from soil and
    dead leaves to rocky outcroppings, of the Garner Run site in Penn State's
    Susquehanna Hills Critical Zone Observatory (CZO).

    "We have pages covered in numbers," Martin said. "One means rocky with no
    canopy, two means a complete soil mantle, and so on. We walked through the
    woods writing these numbers as we go."

    CZO REU Summer Scholar 2016His work has helped produce detailed maps of the
    site, which is part of a Nation Science Foundation-funded network of
    observatories studying the thin layer of Earth that supports human life.
    The numbers he collected could someday help lead to a better understanding
    of the geological processes that shaped the region in the past, and how the
    land surface might behave in the future.

    Martin, a geosciences student at the University of Pittsburgh, was one of
    17 undergraduates from Penn State and universities across the country who
    this year participated in the CZO summer Research Experience for
    Undergraduates and Teachers (REU/RET) program.

    The program, sponsored by the NSF and hosted by Penn State's Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute, paired students with researchers at CZO
    locations at Penn State and the Stroud Environmental Center in southeastern
    Pennsylvania and northern Delaware.

    The goal is to introduce students to the type of cross-disciplinary
    research happening in a CZO, giving them real-world experience and giving
    scientists help with their work.

    "We are getting lots of field work, lots of experience and we're putting
    some skills to the test," Martin said. "It's really cool to just think
    about the big picture, how the ecosystem and plants and soil and rocks all
    come together."

    The CZO program is a network of 10 sites in diverse geographical locations
    in the United States, along with a national office, that studies the layer
    of the Earth that stretches from the tops of trees to the deepest fresh
    groundwater with a cross disciplinary approach. Researchers come from a

    SCRiM hosts Summer Scholars

    Students' research aims at issues surrounding climate change

    September 2016

    UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa -- Some think of summer as a quiet time on a college
    campus, but a diverse group of students spent their break hard at work on a
    common problem – climate change.

    Students and recent graduates from Penn State and universities across the
    country gathered this summer at the University Park campus as part of the
    2016 Summer Scholars Program, hosted by the Network for Sustainable Climate
    Risk Management (SCRiM).

    SCRiM Summer Scholar 2016

    The Summer Scholars program brings together students with diverse
    backgrounds – from environmental studies to statistics to philosophy – and
    pairs them with SCRiM researchers for nine weeks of full-time work on
    independent research projects.

    As their backgrounds would suggest, the 21 students explored climate change
    from a number of perspectives, including studying possible social impacts
    on the people threatened most by rising sea levels, and developing tools to
    help decision makers faced with complex issues.

    "When you think of climate change, you usually think of science and hard
    facts behind it," said Zabrenna Griffiths, an undergraduate at Florida
    Agricultural and Mechanical University who participated in the program. "I
    really like the approach SCRiM takes. It's interdisciplinary, so you have
    an ethical side, a statistical side and a science side."

    SCRiM, a National Science Foundation-supported research network centered at
    Penn State, seeks to find sustainable, scientifically sound,
    technologically feasible, economically efficient and ethically defensible
    climate risk management strategies.

    "I think climate change is a very interdisciplinary problem," said Rachana
    Ghimire, an undergraduate student at Washington and Lee University and
    summer scholar. "Since it's that type of problem, it requires that type of
    solution, and I think that's what makes SCRiM so unique."

    Ghimire worked this summer under the supervision of Martin Vezer, a
    postdoctoral scholar with SCRiM, analyzing flood maps and social
    vulnerability in a section of New Orleans. Ghimire said she gained valuable
    insight working with her mentor and alongside students from varying
    backgrounds.

    "In my program this year, we have geology majors, we have biology majors,
    we have ecology majors, we have economics majors and we have philosophy
    majors," she said. "We have all these people from all these disciplines
    being drawn to climate change and looking for different solutions."

    Nina Preston, another summer scholar, studied potential risk of sea level
    rise for people in low lying areas of Bangladesh. Before coming to Penn
    State, Preston didn't know much about how ice dynamics influence sea level
    rise globally. Moving forward, she said, it will be an important part of

    January 2015

    Please join us in congratulating Professor Richard Alley on being awarded
    the prestigious BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Climate
    change. In its citation, the jury praised Alley for his "pioneering
    research" into the "mechanics of ice and its implications for abrupt
    climate change."

    Jury member Miquel Canals refereed to Alley as "our best interpreter of
    ice. Although there are others working in different aspects of the field,
    he is the one who completed the circle: in ice he has read the history of
    the atmosphere, with its phases of abrupt change. He has elucidated its
    mechanisms of formation and deformation and how it interacts with climate.
    Alley explains the present while keeping a window open to the past and
    analyzing possible future paths."

    The BBVA Foundation awards seek to recognize and encourage world-class
    research and artistic creation, prizing contributions of lasting impact for
    their originality, theoretical significance and ability to push back the
    frontiers of the known world. Previous winners include Wally Broecker,
    Klaus Hasselmann, Nicholas Stern, Isaac Held, Susan Solomon, and
    Christopher Field.

    "Climate change doesn't just mean the globe is warming, it also means ice
    is melting," said Dr. Susan L. Brantley, who nominated Alley for the award.
    "Richard Alley is the premier ice specialist in the world and has done more
    than anyone to educate us about changing and moving polar ice. Richard and
    I have worked together for many years in Penn State's Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute and I am exceedingly proud of his
    accomplishments. This award is richly deserved."

    April 2015

    Pollard wins breakthrough of the year award.

    David Pollard, a senior scientist with the Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute, was honored Sunday for his pioneering work modeling glacial ice
    in Greenland and Antarctica.

    Pollard received the Paul F. Robertson Award for Breakthrough of the Year
    at the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences' annual Wilson Awards Banquet.

    Created in 2012 with support from a generous gift by EMS alumnus Paul F.
    Robertson, the award is given for breakthroughs in research or in the
    scholarship of teaching.

    "Dave deserves this award because he is the preeminent person in the world
    who understands how to model ice sheets and ice shelves," said Susan L.
    Brantley, distinguished professor of geosciences and director of EESI. "His
    model is really the best model in terms of quantitatively predicting what
    happens to an ice sheet and ice shelves in terms of change, evolution over
    time. And we are really interested in this, because as the climate changes
    the ice sheet is melting and how that impacts sea level will really impact
    humans around the planet."

    Pollard, who has worked at Penn State for 17 years, has developed a
    world-renowned model noted for its ability to run simulations over
    long-time frames quickly and without sacrificing accuracy. His recent work
    examines the grounding zone, the edges of an ice sheet where the ice
    becomes afloat on the ocean. The zone is a critical region that is
    projected to contribute to sea level rise as ice there melts, breaks and
    enters the ocean at an accelerating pace.

    "Dave has picked out a very interesting way of putting the real physics of
    unstable grounding zones in between really fast pieces of his model on
    either side, so it does a good job of getting the grounding zone right,
    without bogging down the model so it can't do the simulations you need,"
    said Richard Alley, Evan Pugh professor of geosciences and director of
    PSICE, who along with Brantley nominated Pollard for the award.

    Pollard's model suggests there is a potential for self-accelerating,
    runaway retreat as more and more grounded ice in the West Antarctic
    interior is lost to the ocean. Changes in the ice are already contributing
    to sea level rise, and are expected to accelerate in the future.

    "One of the primary reasons we study these big ice sheets is because of the
    potential effect on sea level," Pollard said. "There is so much water
    stored up in these big ice sheets that if substantial parts of them melt in
    the future, as they have in the past, that could change sea level."

    EESI staff learn about Penn State's expanded composting programAl

    Composting expert Al Matyasovsky discusses Univeristy's efforts to cut
    waste

    November 2013

    Penn State is giving new life to thousands of tons of garbage that would
    typically get shipped to a landfill -- turning it into a gardener's dream
    ingredient -- compost.

    The program, formerly known as "No Can Do" and now named "Mobius" is being
    expanded to include composting bins in buildings all across campus. The
    university is asking faculty, staff and students to toss that banana peel,
    paper napkin and unfinished sandwich into building composting bins, not the
    garbage cans.

    "It's about doing the right thing with our waste and managing it," said Al
    Matyasovsky, supervisor of central support services in the Office of
    Physical Plant, during a recent talk he gave about composting to faculty
    and staff in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences' Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute.

    The composting program is now in about 70 buildings, including
    Earth-Engineering Science and Deike buildings. Matyaskovsky said about four
    to five buildings are being added each week, with an end goal of reaching
    all 742 buildings on campus in the next few years. It's part of the
    University-wide effort to dramatically reduce landfill waste, which
    includes other initiatives such as the annual Trash to Treasure sale. In
    that case, students who are moving out of on-campus housing donate their
    usable items that are then resold rather than being pitched in the garbage
    and sent to a landfill.

    In the case of composting, faculty, staff and students toss their organic
    garbage in the composting bin. Those bins are outfitted with compostable
    bags made from corn starch and cotton seed and collected frequently to head
    off problems with odor and insects. The composting rule, Matyasovsky said,
    is: "if it rots, pitch it in."

    From those bins, the compost is taken to the university's central
    composting site, where it's turned into black gold that's later used to
    fertilize the plants and trees around campus. Last year, Penn State
    produced 15,372 tons of garbage, but 9,853 tons or 65 percent of it was
    diverted from the landfills. That year, the university produced 1,300 tons
    of compost — a number that will grow as the program expands.

    "We're not going to be satisfied until nothing goes into a landfill,"
    Matyasovsky said. For more information on the program, go to Penn State

    October 2013

    Scientists who master the art of communication not only do a good job
    explaining their work and its importance, they become better scientists in
    the process.

    That was the message of Nancy Baron, a science communications expert who
    talked at Penn State in September as part of a workshop she held for
    faculty in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences' Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute and the Penn State Institutes of Energy and
    the Environment.

    "Going public forces you to distill facets of your work, and to think
    harder about the questions, the scientific questions, what's known and
    what's still left to discover," Baron said. "Being a communicator isn't an
    add-on. It makes you better at science."

    Peter Wilf and colleagues (photo)

    Baron is director of science outreach at COMPASS, which helps scientists
    communicate their work to journalists, policy makers and the public. She is
    author of "Escape from the Ivory Tower: A Guide to Making Your Science
    Matter," lead trainer for the Leopold Leadership Program and recipient of
    the 2013 Peter Benchley Ocean Award for Excellence in Media.

    Among the advice Baron shared with the students and faculty in the audience
    was to be transparent when presenting information; find effective metaphors
    for explaining complex subjects; and be yourself.

    The Penn State Institutes of Energy and the Environment and the Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute in the College of Earth and Mineral
    Sciences sponsored her visit to University Park. Along with the talk, "The
    Risks and Rewards of Science Communication," Baron's visit included a
    daylong workshop with EMS and PSIEE faculty focused on finding ways to
    effectively communicate their research subjects.

    Penn State faculty at workshop (photo)"People will turn to you because you
    have that clarity of expression — the ability to cut to the chase," she
    said. "So if each of you was to think of somebody who you really admire as
    a leader, chances are they are an effective communicator."

    EESI project part of new NSF report focused on research taking place in the
    "critical zones"

    Report features Penn State EESI initiative looking at areas impacted by
    Marcellus Shale gas drilling

    July 2013

    A new report from the National Science Foundation offers a look at the work
    being done by researchers who are studying what is known as the Earth's
    critical zone, including the research a Penn State team is leading in the
    Susquehanna Shale Hills.

    "Discoveries in the Critical Zone: Where Life Meets Rock" by Cheryl Dybas,
    of the NSF, is available as a pdf on the Critical Zone Observatory website.

    In the introduction to the report, Wendy Harrison, director of the Division
    of Earth Sciences at the NSF, says that scientists involved in the projects
    are "seeking answers."

    "They're working to understand Earth's critical zone -- the region between
    the top of the tree canopy and the base of weathered rock -- and its
    response to climate and land use changes," Harrison says.

    The section of the report focused on the Susquehanna Shale Hills in
    Pennsylvania notes that the project being led by Sue Brantley,
    distinguished professor of geosciences at Penn State, has been expanded to
    include a Marcellus Shale Research Network, focused on collecting data
    about water quality in the region where natural gas drilling using deep
    horizontal drilling has taken off.

    "Successfully developing new energy resources while maintaining healthy
    ecosystems is the very heart of sustainability," Brantley says.

    For the full report, go to the Critical Zone Observatory or the NSF.

    EESI research featured on new YouTube and Facebook pages

    "Slices of Time" and other videos available online

    June 2013

    “Slices of Time,” a 13-minute video explaining how the earth’s surface can
    change in processes that happen in millionths of a second or over the
    course of millions of years, is available on Penn State’s Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute’s YouTube and Facebook pages.

    Using a stream affected by acid mine drainage to explain how changes occur
    in a landscape, the video shows what happens in that stream over time —
    from water molecules attacking the pyrite at speeds too fast to see with
    the naked eye to weathering breaking down rocks naturally over thousands of
    years.

    Another video on the EESI YouTube and Facebook pages features the
    interdisciplinary research being done through the Susquehanna Shale Hills
    Critical Zone Observatory project. The Penn State researchers explain the
    work they’re doing in the Huntingdon County Shale Hills as part of a larger
    National Science Foundation initiative aimed at understanding the earth’s
    critical zone.

##  News Archive 2013 - Study finds need for water quality data in the Marcellus Shale region 


     Marcellus Shale region

    2013 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    Review finds need for more water quality data in the Marcellus shale region

    May 2013

    What to do with Marcellus Shale wastewater is one of the biggest concerns
    in Pennsylvania, and few published studies have evaluated such wastewater
    effects on regional waters, according to a review coauthored by professors
    at the University of Pittsburgh and Penn State University.

    Published online today in the peer-reviewed journal Science, the review
    stresses the need for scientific data on water pollution caused by
    hydraulic fracturing and cites a lack of monitoring stations and
    requirements concerning confidentiality as potential causes. The review is
    titled "Impact of Shale Gas Development on Regional Water Quality."

    Susan L. Brantley, Distinguished Professor of Geosciences at Penn State and
    coauthor of the review, said the findings highlight the need for more
    thorough and consistent water quality monitoring and more information about
    risk factors associated with the different parts of the region where deep
    horizontal drilling is taking place.

    "Natural gas migration is a well-known natural phenomenon in many areas of
    Pennsylvania even before gas well drilling. When gas wells are drilled,
    sometimes the gas migrates around the well and into the groundwater. Though
    this is not common, more information is needed about the site-specific risk
    factors that contribute to those problems," Brantley said. "Geological
    conditions can vary from one gas drilling site to another, and without that
    information it will be difficult to definitively answer the question of
    whether gas extraction through hydraulic fracturing is having an impact of
    water resources."

    Intensive extraction of gas inside of the Marcellus shale began in the
    eastern United States in 2005 and the Marcellus has quickly become one of
    the top five unconventional gas reservoirs in the country. Previous studies
    have estimated this area could yield 489 trillion cubic feet of natural
    gas—an amount requiring high volumes of water used for what is often
    referred to as "slickwater fracturing."

    Major concerns for the public have been whether stray methane can
    contaminate water supplies and whether the chemicals in the fluid used
    during the hydraulic fracturing process pose a threat to drinking water
    aquifers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is currently studying
    the risks to groundwater from hydraulic fracturing.

    "While stray gas can be minor and easily remedied, there has been one case
    attributed to a Marcellus shale well in which stray gas accumulation in a
    private water well was associated with an explosion that blew a concrete
    lid off the well," said Brantley, director of the Earth and Environmental
    Systems Institute at Penn State.

    The main cause of stray gas in private water wells is not having an
    adequate cement seal around the well and to a sufficient depth, which can
    allow the natural gas to migrate up into the groundwater.

    March 2013

    Three faculty members and a staff member in the College of Earth and
    Mineral Sciences were among those singled out this year for recognition by
    the University for excellence in education and research.

    Susan L. Brantley, distinguished professor of geosciences and director of
    the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute, received the Faculty Scholar
    Medal for work in the physical sciences. Peter Wilf, associate professor of
    geosciences, received a George W. Atherton Award for Excellence in
    Teaching. Robert Crane, professor of geography and director of the Alliance
    for Education, Science, Engineering and Development in Africa, received the
    W. LaMarr Kopp International Achievement Award for advancing the
    university's international mission. Martha Traverse, administrative
    assistant, received the Staff Excellence Award.

    President Rodney Erickson presented the 2013 awards at a recent recognition
    event. The honors are given to faculty and staff each year in honor of
    outstanding contributions. The four EMS employees were among those singled
    out for their excellence in teaching, research and service.

    "Penn State's strengths in the engineering and physical sciences are its
    imprimatur. Sue, Peter, Rob and Martha are the latest members of the
    College of Earth and Mineral Sciences to prove that they are a cut above,"
    said William Easterling, dean of the College.

    Brantley received the 2013 award for physical sciences in recognition of
    her pioneering work in applying chemical and physical principles to
    geological processes at the earth's surface, including weathering and
    erosion.

    Brantley said she was honored and surprised to get the Faculty Scholar
    medal at a college and university with so many talented scientists.

    "The best part of getting the medal was listening to the stories of all the
    other awardees, and being part of the terrific creativity we have here at
    Penn State," she said.

    Brantley has been a faculty member at Penn State since 1986. Her recent
    work includes research focused on the "critical zone," the planet's surface
    that sustains human life. One nominator said that the quantitative reactive
    transport models she developed represent a breakthrough for modeling
    weathering in the critical zone on the geological time scale and that the
    results have "broad implications" for understanding the role that
    weathering plays in soil formation, the fate of contaminants and the
    sequestration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide.

    Brantley is also a founder of the Shale Network, a collaborative effort by
    researchers from Penn State and other institutions to collect data on water
    quality in the shale gas drilling regions.

    In addition to her research and teaching, Brantley is director of the Earth

    EESI announces a new High Performance Computing resource

    October 2012

    EESI would like to announce a new High Performance Computing resource that
    is available:

    Research Computing and Cyberinfrastructure (RCC) has just brought their
    newest HPC cluster, Lion XG, on line. Each computing server blade includes
    two Intel Xeon E5-2665 2.4 GHz 8-core processors (Sandybridge series), with
    64 or 128 gigabytes of 1600 MHz memory (4 or 8 gigabytes per core), 2.5" 1
    terabyte 7200 rpm NL-SAS drive, 56 gigabits/second FDR Infiniband
    interconnect (Mellanox Connect-X3 HCA and switches), and a separate 10
    gigabits/second Ethernet network and also a 10 Gbps uplink. This hardware
    is likely to have a formal life span of three years but RCC typically runs
    a cluster several years beyond that period.

    David Pollard received NSF funds to contribute to this for his research,
    and EESI partnered to secure priority access to 15 nodes on Lion-XG for
    EESI associates. As an EESI associate, if you would like to use this new
    cluster please contact John Miley at jmiley@eesi.psu.edu to arrange access.

    One important thing to note about Lion-XG is that it is running RedHat
    Enterprise Linux 6 as its operating system whereas the older Lion-X systems
    are all running RedHat Enterprise Linux 5. Because of this some codes that
    were compiled on the older systems will not run on Lion-XG without
    recompilation. In particular, if you are running anything on the older
    systems that was compiled with RCC's OpenMPI implementation, you will need
    to recompile due to ABI incompatibilities with the new OpenMPI version.
    Eventually all RCC cluster will be upgraded to RedHat Enterprise Linux 6.

    To see how Lion-XG compares to previous RCC clusters: http://
    rcc.its.psu.edu/resources/hpc/ (Lion-XG was decommissioned in December
    2017; link expired)

    For more specific details on Lion-XG please see: http://rcc.its.psu.edu/
    resources/hpc/lionxg/ (Lion-XG was decommissioned in December 2017; link
    expired)

    For information on using and accessing Lion-XG please see the RCC lion-x
    user guide: http://rcc.its.psu.edu/user_guides/systems/lionx/ (Lion-XG was
    decommissioned in December 2017; link expired)

     

    Please also note that whenever you write a proposal to get more such HPC
    equipment, EESI often can partner with you to provide more priority access
    to others in EESI.

    New Faculty Member Publishes in NatureJennifer Balch (photo)

    Jennifer K. Balch, who will join the faculty in Penn State’s Department of
    Geography in August 2012 as an assistant professor and EESI associate,
    co-authored a recent publication in Nature, entitled "The Amazon basin in
    transition." Jennifer is currently a postdoctoral associate at UC Santa
    Barbara’s National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis(NCEAS). Her
    research looks at the patterns and processes that underlie fire disturbance
    and ecosystem recovery, particularly in tropical forests.

    The recent Nature article reveals that human activity has begun to alter
    the regional water and energy cycles of the Amazon basin. The danger is
    that the Amazon may be shifting from a carbon sink to a carbon source. A
    strong sign of a new disturbance regime is the high number of recent
    large-scale wildfires, which are a byproduct of intentional fires in
    Brazil’s ‘arc of deforestation.’ In addition, it shows that ongoing
    interactions of deforestation, fire, and climate change have the potential
    to alter carbon storage, rainfall patterns and river discharge on an even
    larger basinwide scale. These wildfires are extremely frequent, occurring
    every few years, compared with every couple centuries in the past. To view
    the UCSB-NCEAS press-release go to: http://www.ia.ucsb.edu/pa/display.aspx?

    ShaleNetwork Workshop Held April 22-23 in State College, PA

    April 2012

    Forty-one participants attended the ShaleNetwork Workshops at the Atherton
    Hotel, State College, PA on April 22-23, 2012. The workshop was presented
    by researchers from Penn State University, the University of Pittsburgh,
    Dickinson College, and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement
    of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc. (CUAHSI). With funds from the National Science
    Foundation (NSF), these researchers have been working since October 2011 to
    create the ShaleNetwork database as an online database. The ShaleNetwork
    team is also testing whether the inclusion of data from groups of citizen
    scientists can promote discovery and public education. The database
    currently contains data from community watershed groups, academic
    scientists, government agencies, and industry and includes analyses of 60
    different constituents for some samples.

    Of the 41 workshop attendees, 23 derived from universities, 6 from
    government agencies, 2 from environmental consulting firms, 3 from county
    district offices, and 7 from non-profit organizations. The participants
    were introduced to the ShaleNetwork database through HydroDesktop (
    www.hydrodesktop.org) a publicly available web service maintained by
    CUAHSI. By placing the ShaleNetwork database online at a CUAHSI
    Hydroserver, the data can be accessed along with data from the United
    States Geologic Survey, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other
    groups hosting data on Hydroservers around the country. Currently, data has
    been uploaded for surface waters, groundwaters, waste effluent, flowback
    and production waters.

    April 30th at 7 pm in room 101 Thomas Building at Penn State’s University
    Park, a group of esteemed Penn State faculty and one graduate student/
    lecturer will confront the climate change denial machine. Over the last few
    years, we have been discouraged by the successful of "the merchants of
    doubt," a well-organized and well-funded climate change disinformation
    campaign. The five presenters of “Changing the Moral Climate on Climate
    Change” believe that as people working at a top-flight research and
    teaching institution, they have a responsibility to both inform the public
    about the many aspects of climate change – from social to environmental –
    and call for better action from universities in democratic society.

    Presentations come from Dr. (Juris) Donald Brown from Science, Technology,
    and Society and former Clinton administration UN representative and blogger
    at Climate Ethics, Peter Buckland, A.B.D. in Educational Theory and Policy
    and co-host of Sustainability Now Radio, Dr. Janet Swim from Psychology and
    chair of the 2009 American Psychological Associations task force on the
    psychology of climate change, Dr. Rick Schuhmann, an environmental engineer
    and Director of Penn State’s Engineering Leadership program, and Dr.
    Michael Mann, director of Penn State’s Earth System Science Center, member
    of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
    Change, and author of The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars.

    Ken Davis Measures Greenhouse Gas Emissions for World Economic Forum

    January 2012

    Ken Davis’s research group is measuring greenhouse gas emissions from the
    World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The meeting started on 25
    January and runs through Sunday, 29 January. Picarro, Inc., an instrument
    company that makes greenhouse gas sensors, was selected to be a technology
    innovation demonstration company at the WEF, and recruited Davis's research
    group as partners in the demonstration. Davis's group is a leader in
    developing the techniques needed to measure regional greenhouse gas fluxes
    using atmospheric budgets, and has a long history of working with Picarro
    instruments in their field experiments. The demonstration is monitoring CO2
    emissions from the mountain village of Davos in near real time as the WEF
    takes place. In addition to the Picarro greenhouse gas sensors, the
    experiment relies heavily upon meteorological simulations using the Weather
    Research and Forecast realtime forecasting system with chemistry, a
    community model modified for experiments such as this by scientists in the
    Department of Meteorology. The investigators hope to detect changes in
    emissions that occur as a result of the WEF, showing the utility of the
    method for monitoring "urban metabolism." These methods could be used by
    cities to evaluate the efficacy of efforts to reduce urban greenhouse gas
    emissions. Picarro hopes that the demonstration will serve as a call to
    city leaders to adopt active monitoring of urban greenhouse gas emissions.
    Results of the study will be released this Friday, 27 January.

    More information, including observations and models of CO2 concentrations
    and fluxes around Davos created by Picarro and Penn State scientists, can
    be seen at http://citycarbon.picarro.com.

    This project is supported in part by the Penn State Institutes of Energy
    and the Environment (PSIEE) and the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences.
    Davis is Professor of Meteorology in the Department of Meteorology, and is
    a faculty associate of the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute, both
    part of the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences. Other Penn State
    researcher contributing to the project include Aijun Deng, Thomas Lauvaux,
    Natasha Miles and Scott Richardson, all members of the Department of
    Meteorology.

    Richard Alley Receives the Stephens Schneider Award for Climate
    Communication

    December 2011

    December 6, 2011, Climate One at the Commonwealth Club presented Dr.
    Richard Alley, esteemed geologist and professor at Pennsylvania State
    University, the first Stephen Schneider Award for Climate Communication.
    The event was held in San Francisco, California near where the 2011
    American Geophysical Union Conference took place.

    Dr. Richard Alley is known for his clever presentation of key climate
    change issues to the public. He has testified before Congress using his
    bald head to illustrate ice age cycles, recorded a video on geoscience
    while playing Johnny Cash, and hosted the PBS documentary “Earth: The
    Operators Manual.” At the event, Dr. Alley offers fresh insights in climate
    science, communication, and the politicization of scientific inquiry.
    Several distinguished scientists and friends of the late Stanford
    climatologist, Stephen Schneider, were in the audience and Dr. Alley and
    two other scholars closed the program with a tune.

    Climate One programs are broadcast on public radio and local access
    television. Their live audience has the opportunity to be face to face with
    leaders in energy efficiency and environmental policies.

    More information about Climate One and upcoming programs can be found on
    their website, and tickets can be purchased for upcoming programs here.

##  News Archive 2011 - 'Toward a Marcellus Flowback Water "Signature”, and Perspectives on Environmental Impacts' 


     Environmental Impacts'

    November 2011

    Carl Kirby, Bucknell University, Department of Geology

    The most likely sources of surface and groundwater contamination from
    hydraulic fracturing for natural gas extraction from the Marcellus and
    other shales are disturbance of coalbed methane, well casing failure, and
    surface leaks and spills. Currently there is no reliable chemical
    “signature” or “fingerprint” that can delineate Marcellus flowback waters
    from other sources with high conductivity such as mine drainage or road
    salt. A combination of selected geochemical parameters including Cl, Br,
    SO4, and stable isotopes appears that it will provide unique identifiers
    for Marcellus flowback waters.

    Q: Is gas extraction and production in the Marcellus safe?

    A: Is driving a car safe?

    The above is the wrong question. What we need to know is the risks of
    environment impacts due to shale gas extraction. Much of the data we need
    to understand the risks is lacking. The risks need to be analyzed and then
    compared to past and especially environmental impacts of extractive
    industries and other development.

     

    Dr. Kirby's talk will take place in 112 Walker Building at 4:00 p.m. on
    November 14

    Brantley honored with Arthur L. Day Medal

    October 2011

    Susan L. Brantley, director of the Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute, is the recipient of the 2011 Arthur L. Day Medal from the
    Geological Society of America (GSA).

    GSA announced Brantley's award in its July 2011 issue of GSA Today.

    Brantley, Distinguished Professor of Geosciences, is a leading scientist in
    the study of the complex chemical and geological processes that shape and
    transform the Critical Zone, the part of the Earth where rock meets life
    extending from groundwater to the top of vegetation. She has been credited
    with making breakthrough contributions in understanding weathering
    processes and their interaction with the atmosphere and biological systems
    and with being a pioneer in the application of iron isotopes to soil
    processes.

    "Her uncommon vision has broken ground in geochemical research by
    identifying new and significant research avenues for her colleagues in her
    own generation and the next," wrote one nominee of Brantley's
    contributions.

    Another nominee described Brantley as "the outstanding aqueous geochemist
    of her generation."

    Her research investigating geochemical processes in natural systems has
    been supported by the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of
    Energy and NASA. She is a co-PI of the 20-acre Susquehanna Shale Hills
    Observatory, located near the University's Stone Valley Recreation Center
    and part of the NSF-supported Critical Zone Observatory network.

    In the 63-year history of the award, Brantley is the first Penn State
    faculty member to receive the Arthur L. Day Medal while working at the
    University. The 1967 prize went to O. Frank Tuttle, who joined Penn State
    in 1953 and served as dean of the College of Mineral Industries from
    1959-60 but who was at Stanford University when he received the medal.

    Richard Alley receives prestigious Heinz AwardDavid Pollard (photo)

    September 2015

    Penn State University Professor, Dr. Richard Alley, discovered massive
    climate shifts can happen abruptly

    PITTSBURGH, September 13, 2011 − Teresa Heinz and the Heinz Family
    Foundation today announced Richard Alley, Ph. D., a professor at The
    Pennsylvania State University and leader in climate and polar ice studies,
    as a recipient of a $100,000 Heinz Award. Dr. Alley has been a professor at
    The Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pa. since 1988.

    Dr. Alley's research broke open the field of "abrupt climate change," with
    his discovery that the last Ice Age came to an abrupt end over a period of
    only three years. This has significant implications for the present day as
    it debunked the myth that climate change is a very slow process, and
    suggests that some climate changes in response to human-induced activities,
    particularly the burning of fossil fuels, may arrive more rapidly than
    expected. Dr. Alley and others had removed two-mile long polar ice core
    samples in Greenland and in Antarctica to study climate history and
    elements that lead to climatic changes.

    "Dr. Alley"s research on ice cores has provided an essential cornerstone to
    the study of environmental change," Teresa Heinz, chairman of the Heinz
    Family Foundation, said today. "He discovered that such changes can be
    abrupt and massive and he is able to communicate these complex ideas in a
    clear and compelling way."

    Dr. Alley is considered one of the most active voices in communicating
    earth sciences to the general public. Earlier this year, he hosted a PBS
    special on climate change and sustainable energy called Earth: The
    Operators' Manual. He authored a companion book by the same name that was
    targeted to everyday Americans. From low-tech solutions to high-tech
    innovations, the documentary shows the wide range of practical options
    available to meet Earth's growing need for energy.

    "Climate change is an enormous challenge that requires big action. Our
    grandchildren will one day ask us to explain the choices our leaders made
    today," said Dr. Alley.

    Now in their 17th year, the Heinz Awards honor visionaries who have made
    extraordinary contributions to the environment, a life-long area of
    commitment for the late U.S. Senator John Heinz. Dr. Alley and nine others
    are recognized for their significant efforts benefitting the environment.
    This year's awards total $900,000.

    Dr. Alley is active in the scientific community, having presided over the
    National Academy of Sciences' report Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable
    Surprises, and as a lead author on the International Panel of Climate
    Change Fourth Assessment Report: Working Group I: ThePhysical Science Basis
    .Regularly testifying before congressional committees and policymakers on
    climate change, he joined other prominent scientists last year at a
    briefing on Capitol Hill sponsored by the American Association for the
    Advancement of Science to address questions raised by climate change
    skeptics.

    In addition to Dr. Alley, the 17th Heinz Awards are honoring the following

##  News Archive 2011 - Seamus McGraw - Marcellus Shale Author  


 
    2011 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    Seamus McGraw - Marcellus Shale Author

    September 2011

    Marcellus Author: "It's About Making Hard Choices in a Hard Land in Hard
    Times"

    Journalist and Pennsylvania native Seamus McGraw will share portraits of
    northeastern Pennsylvania landowners who suddenly discover their farms sit
    atop a natural gas bonanza and their struggles to make the right family,
    environmental and moral decisions about leasing their land Thursday, Sept.
    15 in the Foster Auditorium, 102 Paterno Library.

    In The End of Country published in June 2011, McGraw draws on his personal
    knowledge of the region and its residents to weave together a portrait of
    the land and the people against the backdrop of Marcellus Shale
    development.

    Some environmentalists have decried what they see as the book's endorsement
    of a fossil fuel while some in the industry have bristled at its candid
    portrayal of the risks of natural gas drilling, dubbing it "'Gasland' on
    paper," McGraw says.

    "My book is not about dogmatic, partisan, ideological points of view but
    about very real people trying to do the right thing in a very complicated
    situation," McGraw says. "I want people to see and identify with the
    reality that transcends the dogma."

    Open to the public, McGraw's reading and talk will begin at noon. A book
    signing will follow at 1 p.m. This event is sponsored by the Penn State
    Marcellus Center for Outreach and Research (marcellus.psu.edu) and the Penn
    State University Libraries. For more information, contact the Marcellus

##  News Archive 2011 - New EESI-Supported Initiative in Energy and Environmental Economics and Policy 


     Environmental Economics and Policy

    2011 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    New EESI-Supported Initiative in Energy and Environmental Economics and
    Policy

    July 2011

    EEEP - established in Summer 2011

    EESI is one of several research units on campus supporting a new
    cross-College Initiative focused on the study of economic and policy
    challenges related to energy production and utilization; the management of
    environmental resources; and the environmental impacts of energy systems.
    The Energy and Environmental Economics and Policy Initiative (EEEP) was
    established during the summer of 2011, following the annual EESI Center
    Competition. The Initiative also receives support from PSIEE and the
    Environment and Natural Resources Institute, housed in the College of
    Agriculture. Seth Blumsack, from the Leone Family Department of Energy and
    Mineral Engineering; and Karen Fisher-Vanden, from Agricultural Economics
    and Rural Sociology, are the Initiative's co-Directors. Both are trained
    economists but work on research problems that cut across disciplinary
    boundaries.

    The Initiative's goals are to create a network of policy economists across
    Penn State whose activities focus on energy and environmental systems; and
    to foster interdisciplinary research at the boundary of economics, policy
    and the study of environmental or engineered systems. "Our Initiative
    recognizes that society’s energy and environmental challenges are more
    intertwined than ever before," said Blumsack. "Penn State has long had
    strengths in both energy and environmental economics across the University,
    which is a unique and powerful combination. Through EEEP we are hoping to
    coalesce these strengths into a more recognized network."

    The Initiative's activities include running a regular seminar series
    featuring distinguished speakers from inside and outside the University,
    and offering support to participating faculty and graduate students working
    on energy or environmental economics research. The seminar series began in
    the fall of 2011 and will continue into the spring. The seminars have
    featured speakers from Resources for the Future and Carnegie-Mellon
    University, along with Penn State energy and environmental economists.
    Blumsack and Fisher-Vanden are also in the process of seeking approval to
    transform the Initiative into a University-recognized Center. Once Center
    status has been attained, a public web site will be established featuring
    information about the Center’s activities and offering a public portal to
    energy and environmental economics at Penn State.

    Examples of current research projects involving faculty associated with the
    Initiative include:

      □ Co-Director Karen Fisher-Vanden is a lead author for the IPCC fifth
        assessment report, in the Climate Change Mitigation working group.
      □ R.J. Briggs has been investigating the role of deregulation and
        institutional change in the electric power sector on air emissions from
        generating plants.
      □ Co-director Seth Blumsack has published two recent papers examining the
        impacts of wind energy development on environmental quality.  One
        paper, published in Energy Policy discusses how wind-turbine siting
        decisions affect emissions from electric power systems (see figure);
        the other, forthcoming in Journal of Regulatory Economics, demonstrates

    Speaker to address managing predicted water-resources stresses and
    water-related hazards

    Matthew Larsen, U.S. Geological Survey, will discuss the critical
    challenges facing national governments attempting to mitigate current and
    predicted water-resources challenges and water-related hazards as part of
    the spring EarthTalks series, "Where Climate Science Meets the Road:
    Managing Resources for Climate Change."

    His talk, "Global Change and Water Resources Management Challenges in the
    Next 100 Years," is scheduled for 4 p.m., Monday, April 25, in 112 Walker.

    "The U.S. and other regions of the world are engaged in national-scale,
    multi-year population, land use and economic experiments which pose major
    water-resources challenges and potential conflicts for the 21st century,"
    said Larsen, associate director with Climate and Land Use Change (USGS).

    "Those include expansion of and shift to irrigated agriculture, degradation
    of riparian and estuarine ecosystems, and population increases in
    water-scarce regions. In addition, climate change models predict
    precipitation and streamflow patterns will change in coming decades,"
    Larsen said.

    "The challenges that we face this century include a combination of local
    and national management problems that are already upon us, as well as
    emerging and future problems that are closely associated with rising
    temperature and changes in the distribution of precipitation," Larsen said.

    Before being named associate director for Climate and Land Use Change in
    2010, Larsen served as USGS's associate director for water. He also has
    served as the chief scientist for hydrology and led the USGS National
    Research Program in hydrology.

    April 4 Dan Vimont EarthTalks Speaker

    April 2011

    Speaker to address challenges in Climate Change Assessment and Information
    Transfer

    Dan Vimont, assistant professor in the University of Wisconsin's
    Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Department, will discuss how the Wisconsin
    Initiative on Climate Change Impacts (WICCI) is both assessing climate
    change impacts on Wisconsin’s natural and built resources and developing
    adaptation strategies for a wide variety of stakeholders.

    His talk, "The Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts: Adapting to
    Climate Change in Wisconsin," is scheduled for 4 p.m., Monday, April 4, in
    112 Walker.

    "One of the challenges of assessing and adapting to climate change involves
    linking information between physical, biological, and social systems,"
    Vimont said. "This information sharing is essential across multiple scales
    of activity and through multiple channels."

    WICCI is engaged in that communication, and Vimont will share the
    organization’s activities with an emphasis on illustrating how WICCI's
    organizational structure facilitates communication between different
    groups.

    Vimont, who serves on the WICCI Science Council, also will present a set of
    downscaled climate data for Wisconsin, including a description of how the
    downscaling technique addresses needs of multiple assessment activities.

    Speaker to examine links between Green Building and Climate Change
    Adaptation

    Chris Pyke, vice president of research for the U.S. Green Building Council,
    will discuss how green building can advance resilience and adaptation to
    climate change as part of the spring EarthTalks series, "Where Climate
    Science Meets the Road: Managing Resources for Climate Change."

    His talk, "Green Building and Climate Change: Developing Practical
    Strategies for Adaptation and Resilience in Built Environments," is
    scheduled for 4 p.m., Monday, March 28, in 112 Walker.

    Green building offers a vision for built environments that are better for
    people and the environment and has become a core part of the real estate
    industry around the world, Pyke says. Today, green building professionals
    understand the role of the built environment in mitigating greenhouse gas
    emissions. But connections to resilience and adaptation have yet to be
    made, and practical, science-based strategies and tools are not widely
    available.

    Pyke also serves as the vice chair of the Chesapeake Bay Program's
    Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee. He is a lead author on Chapter
    9: Buildings for Working Group III (Mitigation for Climate Change) for the
    next assessment report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

##  News Archive 2011 - Keller uses Earth System Analysis to improve Climate Decisions 


     Decisions

    2011 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    Keller uses Earth System Analysis to improve Climate DecisionsKlaus Keller
    (photo)

    January 2011

    Imagine you have to decide whether and how much to raise a levee to protect
    a coastal community from the projected rise in sea levels associated with
    climate change.

    You know that sea levels have risen during the last century and are
    projected to continue to rise-leading to an increased risk of flooding
    absent of adaptations. You also know that raising the levee will reduce the
    flooding risk.

    The question is how much would you raise the levee?

    One option is to heighten the levee by a small amount, hoping that the
    future sea level rise will be at the low end of the projections. A more
    expensive but arguably safer option is to build a higher levee that can
    handle the high-end of the sea-level projections.

    "A workable risk management strategy has to be scientifically sound,
    economically efficient, and ethically defensible—which requires an
    interdisciplinary approach," says Klaus Keller, director of the Center for
    Climate Risk Management (CLIMA) and associate professor of geosciences.
    "Analyzing those strategies requires that natural and social scientists and
    ethicists collaborate effectively—a non-trivial challenge.

    "However, this is a stimulating challenge because the collaborations
    between decision makers, stakeholders and natural and social scientists can
    lead to exciting, mission-oriented basic research," Keller says.

    CLIMA helps this research by catalyzing the interdisciplinary interactions
    that improve the analysis and design of climate risk management strategies.

    To return to the example of how high to raise the levee, the design of
    flood risk management strategies is often driven by low-probability,
    high-impact events such as one-in-100- or one-in-10,000-year flooding.
    Characterizing those low-probability, high-impact events requires
    mechanistically sound models that are carefully tested and calibrated with
    instrumental and paleo observations.

    Keller acknowledges that all models are imperfect, but argues that some can
    still be useful to improve decisions.

    "The basic choice is often: Do we wait for better data and models and in
    the meantime neglect low-probability, high-impact events or do we analyze
    them with imperfect but still useful models?" Keller says. "Neglecting
    low-probability, high-impact events can lead to downward biases in risk
    estimates."

    While climate science is a well-established and active science,
    considerable uncertainties—such as about future sea levels—still remain.
    But uncertainty does not have to result in paralysis.

    We make many decisions under deep uncertainty: which career path to pick,
    whether to marry or whether to purchase life insurance. Hedging against a

    Brooks adresses wetlandsRobert Brooks (photo)

    October 2008

    Robert Brooks to address critical role of wetlands in healthy ecosystems.

    Human activities from farming to construction have degraded many of the
    region's wetlands, but people are learning how to "build" wetlands that
    perform vital ecosystem services such as floodwater storage, water-quality
    improvement and biodiversity conservation.

    That's among the conclusions that Rob Brooks, professor of geography and
    ecology, has reached after 15 years of assessment and restoration research
    in collaboration with faculty, staff, and students of the Penn State
    Cooperative Wetlands Center. Brooks will share those findings on Monday,
    Oct. 20,as part of this year’s EarthTalks colloquium series, "Quenching the
    Thirst."

    His talk, scheduled for 4 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 20, in 112 Walker Building,
    is free and open to the public.

    "Our research has documented the degradation in flora, faunal communities
    and physical attributes, as well as the reduction in wetland functions,
    that has been caused by human activities," says Brooks, who is the Director
    of the Cooperative Wetlands Center. "Fortunately, our data from natural
    reference wetlands can be used to design restored and mitigated wetlands
    and to assess their performance."

    As part of his talk, "Understanding Wetlands, the Other Water: Origins,
    Assessment and Restoration," Brooks will discuss freshwater wetlands, where
    they are found, how they are formed and what ecosystems services they
    provide. He also will examine how wetlands’ interact with streams, rivers,
    lakes and estuaries in a watershed context.

    "Quenching the Thirst" is sponsored by the Earth and Environmental Systems
    Institute, the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, the College of
    Agricultural Sciences and the Penn State Institutes of Energy and the
    Environment.

    2008 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    Proposed 2008-09 Research Centers

    November 2008

    New research centers proposed for EESI

    Proposals for several new centers committed to interdisciplinary research
    and educational activities in environmental sciences were recently aired at
    the EESI Center Proposal Presentations (May 7) as directors of those
    centers detailed their initiatives, noting goals and objectives.

    EESI supports faculty-directed centers with operating funds and staff and
    by providing physical space. Currently, 10 centers are part of EESI.

    Directors of six of EESI's existing centers also outlined their work. Those
    centers include the Center for Energy and Environmental Risk, CEER, Center
    for environmental Kinetics Analysis, CEKA, Center for Environmental
    Informatics, CEI, Earth System Science Center, ESSC, Penn State Ice and
    Climate Research Center, PSICE, and the Center for Public Policy Research
    on the Environment, Energy and Community. EESI also is home to the
    Northeastern Regional Center of the DOE National Institute for Climate
    Change Research located at Penn State.

    The proposed new centers include: Center for Climate Risk Management, CRIM,
    which would be directed by Klaus Keller and which would build
    interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty in engineering, economics,
    earth sciences and statistics. Klaus indicated climate risk management is a
    fast-growing field, and a center with that focus was a natural extension of
    Penn State's expertise in climate risk assessment.

    Center for Land-Air-Water Studies, CLAWS, which will bring together climate
    and soil scientists, chemical and biological oceanographers,
    hydrogeologists and glaciologists to study the critical interfaces of
    global climate change. The center's activities and foci will include
    process studies and fieldwork Anne Thompson would serve as director.

    Riparia which would draw upon and expand the work of the Cooperative
    Wetlands Center. Its focus would include wetlands ecology, landscape
    hydrology and watershed management. Rob Brooks would serve as director.

    The centers which will receive EESI support for 2008-09 will be announced
    in early June.

##  News Archive 2007 - CEKA/EESI high performance computing resource 


 
    2007 News, Highlights, and Accomplishments

    CEKA/EESI high performance computing resource

    July 2007

    The Center for Environmental Kinetics Analysis (CEKA) within the Earth and
    Environmental Systems Institute (EESI) has had its high performance Lion-XO
    cluster online for approximately 18 months now. It continues to be a highly
    successful venture, with 35 active users and full utilization of its
    capacity.This cluster is maintained and operated by the High Performance
    Computing Group (HPC/GEaRS/ASET/ITS) at Penn State University, and CEKA/
    EESI owns 32 quad-processor nodes on this cluster. Although primarily
    intended for CEKA research, this cluster is available for use by any EESI
    associate, with the following proviso. In order to participate, the EESI
    associate must provide a contribution of $5000 per year in salary for EESI
    support personnel (J. Miley, D. Pollard and a computational chemistry
    support person), to provide scientific computational support for EESI users
    of the cluster.

    This scientific support will involve general advice on software, Fortran,
    numerical methods, and help with a limited set of particular models (for
    chemistry: GAUSSIAN, VASP; for climate: GENESIS, MOM2, RegCM3, in-house
    ice-sheet and vegetation models).The standard HPC/GEaRS method of
    computer-time priority and allocation applies to all participating EESI
    users, as follows.

    Each group is assigned a fair-share target equal to the percentage of the
    cluster that they own. For CEKA/EESI, this is currently 44.4% (owning 32*4
    = 128 out of a total 288 CPUs in Lion-XO). Group usage is tracked by HPC
    over a sliding window that is typically 6 weeks.

    As long as the group's usage as a whole is less than their target, their
    jobs continue to run at highest priority. If at any time the group's
    sliding-window usage rises above their target, their jobs will run at low
    priority (treated as non-partner users) until their usage drops below the
    target again. Besides the group-based fair-share above, there is a
    user-based fair share between members of the same group. This is weighted
    many orders of magnitude lower than the group-based fair-share, so that it
    is negligible between groups but still works within them. Although the
    CEKA-group fair-share allocation is shared between all EESI users, it is
    anticipated that over-use will not occur, especially in the next few years,
    and substantial fractions of it will be available to individual heavy
    users. Note that participation with a $5000 EESI-support contribution
    provides much more high-priority CPU-time than an individual purchase of
    one or two nodes on a GEaRS cluster: for instance, the purchase of one
    4-quad node would cost ~$5000 or more, but would only provide fair-share
    usage of 1.4% of Lion-XO, compared to a substantial fraction of CEKA/EESI's
    44.4%.The recently reconstituted Earth System Science Center headed by
    Michael Mann has purchased a similar HPC resource that has been subsidized
    by EESI. This cluster will be managed very similarly to Lion-X0. This
    system has just come online and preliminary testing is about to be
    finished. The system is named Lion-XC and is an Intel based cluster
    currently comprised of 96 nodes. Each node has two dual core 3.0 GHz
    Woodcrest CPU's. By mid-summer this cluster will be fully populated with
    128 dual processor nodes. The ESSC's target priority usage on this system
    is 25% of it's overall future capacity.

    Test results indicate a potential for Lion-XC to run jobs up to 30% faster
    than Lion-XO. There is capacity for 5 researchers to purchase time on this

    Seminars & Conferences - Reactive Transport Modeling Workshop

    Reactive Transport Modeling Workshop

    NSF  workshop: Expanding the role of Reactive Transport Modeling (RTM)
    within the Biogeochemical Sciences

     

    Dates and Location: April 13 – 15, 2014
    Embassy Suites Alexandria Hotel, 1900 Diagonal Road, Alexandria, VA 22314

    The workshop will bring together biogeochemists and reactive transport
    modelers to identify key interfaces between reactive transport modeling
    approaches and biogeochemical data collection and analysis. The specific
    goals of the workshop are to (1) identify the frontiers of reactive
    transport in the biogeochemical sciences, and (2) determine what
    educational and infrastructure development is required to achieve these
    goals.

      □ Workshop agenda
      □ One page white paper

      □ Workshop Logistics, Travel and Reimbursement
      □ RTM Survey

    We designed a survey to collect feedback from the community about the
    educational and development needs in the area of Reactive Transport
    Modeling for biogeochemical studies. It is a short survey and should take 5
    – 10 minutes to finish. Here is the link to the survey: http://
    kwiksurveys.com/s.asp?sid=tcxmlwthiqxop6t322104

    Motivation:

    The formation, operation, and evolution of Earth systems are complex due to
    the coupling of physical, chemical, and biological processes in the
    subsurface. Such coupling plays a pivotal role in the conversion of rock to
    soil, release of nutrients from minerals for ecosystem vitality, and
    cycling of biogeochemically important elements and contaminants. Data
    collection and analysis coupled with field observation have provided
    significant insights into the factors that determine the evolution of the
    critical zone. Mechanistic understanding and prediction of the intimately
    coupled processes, however, often requires advanced modeling tools that can
    integrate large and diverse data sets to quantify the effects of individual
    processes, while at the same time provide a window into the coupled
    processes that may control the overall system behavior.

    Reactive Transport Modeling (RTM) has been used at various research fronts
    for approximately three decades. It has been used to understand complex

    Critical Zone Seminar Series Highlights Earth Surface Research

     

    At Earth's surface, rocks interact with living organisms in the layer known
    as the Critical Zone. To support research on this zone, EESI partners with
    the Department of Crop and Soil Science to bring notable scientists to Penn
    State to share their Critical Zone (CZ) research.

    Listed below are the scientists who have presented their research as part
    of the Critical Zone Seminar series. A committee of CZ researchers at Penn
    State chooses at least one annual speaker for this series. Committee
    members include Jason Kaye and Patrick Drohan, both from Crop and Soil
    Sciences, and Jennifer Macalady and Tim White, both from Geosciences.

    Frontiers in Earth Systems Ecology Annual Seminar

     

    The "Frontiers in Earth Systems Ecology Annual Seminar" reflects EESI's
    commitment to interdisciplinary research and scholarship in this growing
    area.

    This seminar brings to Penn State a respected scientist who has made a
    significant contribution to the field of Earth Systems Ecology. The speaker
    is selected and nominated to the EESI Director or Associate Director by a
    committee of EESI associates and affiliates representing the departments of
    Energy and Mineral Engineering, Geography, Geosciences and Meteorology.

    The goals of this seminar series are to increase the visibility of Earth
    Systems Ecology in EMS and across campus and to highlight the disciplinary
    and interdisciplinary contributions of nominees.

    The speaker will give a seminar in one of the participating department's
    seminar series with departments rotating each year. That department has
    responsibility for hosting the speaker which includes organizing the
    speaker's calendar and identifying individual faculty, graduate students
    and undergraduate students across EMS, and the University to meet with the
    speaker. The speaker also may participate in classes across departments.

    Fall 2019 EarthTalks Series: The Dynamics of Deep Decarbonization

    Mondays at 4:00 p.m. in 112 Walker Building

     

    Achieving truly deep decarbonization is a uniquely difficult problem
    requiring fundamental changes in multiple interconnected systems (energy,
    agriculture, industry). Decisions made with the intent of avoiding the most
    severe climate change climatic impacts happen in the face of deep and
    dynamic uncertainties. Deep decarbonization decisions may also create
    multiple winners and losers and is thus a problem of managing social change
    in addition to technology transition. This Earth Talks series will invite
    prominent researchers to give talks on energy systems transition, negative
    carbon emissions, terrestrial sequestration, decision-making under
    uncertainty, and public policy relevant to deep decarbonization.

    Fall 2014 EarthTalks: Exploring the Oceans

    Mondays at 4:00 pm in 112 Walker Building

     

    Earth Talks: Exploring the Oceans seminar series is being developed to
    engage the Penn State community in marine research. Marine research is a
    highly interdisciplinary field that spans the wide breadth of Penn State's
    departments, colleges, and institutes. This seminar series is sponsored by
    EESI and PSIEE in conjunction with the Center for Marine Science and
    Technology. Typical seminar format will be two 20-min talks each week,
    except in the cases where invited speakers from off-campus will present a
    45-min presentation. The presentation slots are open to all Penn State
    faculty, researchers, and graduate students conducting research in the
    marine environment. Our hope is to schedule 2 different ocean topics within
    each seminar to attract those with diverse interests to listen, learn, and
    network. The seminar will cover topics from coastal to deep water
    environments, ocean technology, and ocean modelling.

    Spring 2012 EarthTalks Series: "Electronic Media and Environmental Science:
    e-Education to e-Data"

    Mondays at 4:00 pm in 112 Walker Building

     

    Electronic media are changing the way we use and find data to understand
    the environment. At the same time, the fraction of U.S. undergraduates that
    took at least one online course between 2000 and 2008 increased from 8-20%.
    Growth in electronic media are thus changing our lives as environmental
    scientists and educators and how we communicate with citizens outside the
    university. This EarthTalks colloquium series will present a slate of
    speakers who will address various aspects of how electronic media is
    changing how we teach and learn and explore the environment, and how this
    media is changing the research university. Speakers will span from local to
    global thinkers on the topic.

    Susan L. Brantley's Spring 2012 EarthTalks Series Abstract

    Dr. Susan L. Brantley, Director, Earth & Environmental Systems Institute

    I invite members of EESI, EMS, and the broader university community to
    engage in a conversation about how electronic media are changing the way we
    use and find data to understand the environment. Many changes are occurring
    and EESI would like to encourage a conversation on this broad topic. For
    example, the fraction of U.S. undergraduates that took at least one online
    course between 2000 and 2008 increased from 8-20%. National Science
    Foundation supports an open data policy for all projects. The USGS is
    providing online water quality and quantity data for citizens; weather
    models are presented online for all to use and see. Sensors and cell phones
    are being used for data collection. Growth in computer capability and
    electronic media are changing our lives as environmental scientists and
    educators and how we communicate with citizens outside the university. I do
    not have the answers about where we are going: but I invite interested
    university members - especially from EESI and EMS -to participate in a
    conversation on this topic and how Penn State can lead in this area. Please
    join me on Monday, January 9, at 4:00 p.m. in 112 Walker Building to start
    the semester-long series and the conversation.

    Seminars & Conferences - Rick Hooper's Spring 2012 EarthTalks Series
    Abstract

    Rick Hooper's Spring 2012 EarthTalks Series Abstract

    Rick Hooper, Executive Director, CUAHSI, Consortium of Universities for
    Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences

    "Sharing Water Data for Research, Education, and Citizen Engagement: The
    web services revolution"

    The emergence of data transmission standards and protocols for
    computer-to-computer web services has transformed the way that government
    agencies, academic researchers, and citizen scientists can discover,
    publish, and display data. The Consortium of Universities for the
    Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) has been developing a
    Hydrologic Information System based using these services and standards that
    allow these groups to publish their data and register metadata in a central
    catalog. Client software can access these services and presente it to
    users. Hydrodesktop, one client developed by CUAHSI HIS, is designed as an
    integrated GIS and data analysis tool (using R) is designed for
    researchers. Other clients can also be developed for these standards for
    other audiences, such as citizens. These technologies open up new ways for
    collaboration and outreach for university scientists.

    Seminars & Conferences - Spring 2011 EarthTalks Series: "Managing Resources
    for Climate Change"

    Spring 2011 EarthTalks Series: "Managing Resources for Climate Change"

    Mondays at 4:00 pm in 112 Walker Building

     

    Planning how best to manage resources that will be affected by climate
    change is the topic of the Earth & Environmental Systems Institute's (EESI)
    spring EarthTalks seminar. Speakers from government agencies and nonprofit
    organizations are among those who will be addressing "Where Climate Science
    Meets the Road: Managing Resources for Climate Change."

    The speakers include:

      □ Nels Johnson, Deputy State Director for The Nature Conservancy, on
        Monday, Feb. 28
      □ Chris Pyke, Vice President of Research, U.S. Green Building Council;
        and Vice Chair, Chesapeake Bay program's Scientific and Technical
        Advisory Committee, on Monday, March 28;
      □ Daniel Vimont, Assistant Professor, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences,
        Center for Climatic Research, University of Wisconsin, on Monday, April
        4;
      □ Matt Larsen, Associate Director, Climate and Land Use Change, U.S.
        Geological Survey, on Monday, April 25.

    All talks will be held at 4 p.m., 112 Walker Building.

    In his talk, Johnson will focus on key findings of the recently completed
    Pennsylvania Climate Change Adaptation Planning Report that identifies the
    most important risks that climate change poses for the state's
    infrastructure, public health, natural resources and recreation and tourism
    industries. The report also indicates steps that can be taken now to reduce
    those impacts.

    "We provide current and relevant climate adaptation information to
    stakeholders including legislators, policy makers, government agencies and
    the public," said Johnson, who served as co-chair for the natural resources
    working group that prepared the report.

    Johnson also will highlight work by The Nature Conservancy to identify
    resilient landscapes and connectivity area in the central Appalachians.

##  Seminars & Conferences - Fall 2010 EarthTalks Series: "Embracing Change: Resilience and Adaptation in Turbulent Times"

    Seminars & Conferences - Fall 2010 EarthTalks Series: "Embracing Change:
    Resilience and Adaptation in Turbulent Times"

    Fall 2010 EarthTalks Series: "Embracing Change: Resilience and Adaptation
    in Turbulent Times"

    Mondays at 4:00 pm in 112 Walker Building

     

    "Embracing Change: Resilience and Adaptation in Turbulent Times" is the
    theme for the 2010 EarthTalks seminar series with scientists, policy makers
    and practitioners from across the nation and abroad joining Penn State
    faculty in discussions on visions for a more sustainable and equitable
    future.

    The 13-week series takes as a starting point that human activities are
    impacting ecosystems and climate in unprecedented ways and threatening the
    various resource bases that sustain both human and ecological well being.

    But rather than give in to doomsday scenarios, the speakers will argue for
    a different approach - resilience or the capacity to regenerate and revive
    after major changes or shocks have occurred.

    "Resilience is the concept that we are better off preparing for and
    adapting to an uncertain future now rather than learning by shock," said
    Petra Tschakert, EESI associate and series organizer.

    "While acknowledging that challenges, surprises and even chaos may lurk
    around the corner, resilience calls for embracing and working with change
    rather than trying to control it."

    Tschakert will lead off the series at 4 p.m. on Monday, August 30, in a
    talk titled "Participatory Learning for Climate Change Adaptation and
    Resilience." Free and open to the public, all talks will be in 112 Walker
    Building.

    Other speakers include Susanne Moser (Sept. 13), who has served as a staff
    scientist for climate change at the Union of Concerned Scientists and who
    is a review editor on the IPCC's Special Report on "Managing the Risks of
    Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation"; Lance
    Gunderson (Oct. 11), founding chair of the Department of Environmental
    Studies at Emory University and former executive director of the Resilience
    Network; and Byron "Ken" Williams (Oct. 18), chief of the Cooperative
    Research Units, U.S. Geological Survey, and lead author of the Department
    of Interior Adaptive Management Technical Guide.

    The 2010 EarthTalks series is sponsored by the Earth and Environmental
    Systems Institute (EESI), the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences, the
    John A. Dutton e-Education Institute, the Department of Geography and the
    Penn State Institutes of Energy and the Environment (PSIEE).

    Abstract

    Susan L. Brantley's Spring 2012 EarthTalks Series Abstract

    Dr. Susan L. Brantley, Director, Earth & Environmental Systems Institute

    I invite members of EESI, EMS, and the broader university community to
    engage in a conversation about how electronic media are changing the way we
    use and find data to understand the environment. Many changes are occurring
    and EESI would like to encourage a conversation on this broad topic. For
    example, the fraction of U.S. undergraduates that took at least one online
    course between 2000 and 2008 increased from 8-20%. National Science
    Foundation supports an open data policy for all projects. The USGS is
    providing online water quality and quantity data for citizens; weather
    models are presented online for all to use and see. Sensors and cell phones
    are being used for data collection. Growth in computer capability and
    electronic media are changing our lives as environmental scientists and
    educators and how we communicate with citizens outside the university. I do
    not have the answers about where we are going: but I invite interested
    university members - especially from EESI and EMS -to participate in a
    conversation on this topic and how Penn State can lead in this area. Please
    join me on Monday, January 9, at 4:00 p.m. in 112 Walker Building to start
    the semester-long series and the conversation.

    Abstract

    Rick Hooper's Spring 2012 EarthTalks Series Abstract

    Rick Hooper, Executive Director, CUAHSI, Consortium of Universities for
    Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences

    "Sharing Water Data for Research, Education, and Citizen Engagement: The
    web services revolution"

    The emergence of data transmission standards and protocols for
    computer-to-computer web services has transformed the way that government
    agencies, academic researchers, and citizen scientists can discover,
    publish, and display data. The Consortium of Universities for the
    Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI) has been developing a
    Hydrologic Information System based using these services and standards that
    allow these groups to publish their data and register metadata in a central
    catalog. Client software can access these services and presente it to
    users. Hydrodesktop, one client developed by CUAHSI HIS, is designed as an
    integrated GIS and data analysis tool (using R) is designed for
    researchers. Other clients can also be developed for these standards for
    other audiences, such as citizens. These technologies open up new ways for
    collaboration and outreach for university scientists.
